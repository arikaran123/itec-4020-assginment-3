Begun in 1969, the award is given to the best full-length novel published in the previous 12 months; nominees are chosen from among the nations of the current and former British Commonwealth. The aim of the prize is to stimulate the kind of public interest aroused in France by the Prix Goncourt. In the last few years, a similar prize was begun in Russia; that award is named the Russian Booker. 1996  Last Orders, by Graham Swift 1995  The Ghost Road, by Pat Barker 1994  How Late It Was, How Late, by James Kelman 1993  Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, by Roddy Doyle 1992  The English Patient, by Michael Ondaatje       Sacred Hunger, by Barry Unsworth 1991  Famished Road, by Ben Okri 1990  Possession: A Romance, by A.

He was also an unsuccessful writer of novels and plays. When a newspaper accidentally printed his obituary and referred to him as a "merchant of death," Nobel realized that would be how he would be remembered. To overt such a legacy, Nobel set aside more than $9 million for the establishment of the Nobel Prizes. These annual awards - given in various catagories including literature - are given to individuals who have benefitted humanity through their work.

Click on the categories below to jump around this page. BRIEF LITERARY HISTORY // NOTABLE BOOKS // SOME SIGNIFICANT WRITERS A BRIEF HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA LITERATURE The literary history of California begins with the oral traditions of the Native Californians and continues with the writing and printing of occasional pieces - such as religious works, Christmas pastoreles and anonymous poems - during the Spanish and Mexican periods. Perhaps as significant as these locally produced works were those of French, English and American visitors. Most important of these is Richard Henry Dana's "Two Years Before the Mast" (1840), the story of a sea voyage which ends in San Francisco and which attracted considerable attention to the region. However, not until the Gold Rush brought a large foreign population - mainly from the United States, did the written word flourish locally. The first journal to aim at something more than just printed reports was the "Golden Era," which attracted contributions from the then new state's first literary figures. Later, other journals such as "The Pioneer," "Hutchings' California Magazine" and the "Overland Monthly" sprang up. Together they would help launch the careers of Bret Harte, Mark Twain, Fitz Hugh Ludlow, Joaquin Miller and Ina Coolbrith. Beginning in the 1860's, each would go on to establish considerable reputations with their own books. Typical of the local color found in these works is Twain's "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County" (1872). During the 1880's and 1890's a different set of authors established themselves as representitive of California. These included the short story writer Ambrose Bierce, pioneering science fiction writer Robert Duncan Milne, naturalist John Muir, historian Hubert H. Bancroft and the romantic novelist Helen Hunt Jackson. Social protest and progressive reform marked the efforts of early 20th century novelists. Frank Norris - best known for "The Octopus" (1901); Jack London - author of "Sea Wolf" (1904), "The Iron Heel" (1907) and "Martin Eden" (1909); and Gertrude Atherton - whose "The Californians" (1898) and other works were considered daring for a woman of the time, all achieved prominence. Mary Austin - author of the classic "Land of Little Rain" (1903), was a founder of an artistic colony at Carmel early in the century. Other members would include the Bohemian poet George Sterling, and later, Robinson Jeffers. Jeffers - whose fame would eventually place him on the cover of "Time" magazine - made symbolic use of the California coast in long verse tragedies and intense lyrics during the 1920's, 1930's and 1940's. Naturalism and social realism also marked the fiction of muckraking novelist and Gubernatorial candidate Upton Sinclair, as well as John Steinbeck, whose "The Grapes of Wrath" (1939) and other works depicted the plight of migratory agricultural workers during the Depression. The works of Fresno-born William Saroyan, Los Angeles chronicler John Fante and later longtime Stanford professor Wallace Stegner similarly reflect a naturalism steeped in regionalism. Other notable fiction writers of mid-century and after include Henry Miller (who relocated to Big Sur in 1941), "hardboiled" detective fiction writers Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and James M. Cain, and Wright Morris, Tillie Olsen, Evan S. Conell, Richard Brautigan, Joan Didion and Los Angeles icon Charles Bukowski. The post-War years witnessed the emergence of an alternative poetic tradition in Northern California. Spearheaded by established Bay Area poets Kenneth Rexroth, Robert Duncan, Kenneth Patchen and William Everson - the Beat poets of San Francisco, Berkeley, Bolinas and elsewhere opened-up poetic form and content. Their interactions with Los Angeles artists and New York writers formed the Beat movement. Among the leading proponents of the new American poetry are Northern Californians Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Michael McClure and Gary Synder. The exploding immigrant population and growing multiculturalism of California has led to an ever changing literature. From the African - American, Hispanic, and Asian - American communities have emerged significant writers in all genres. Representitive of the African - American voice are Pulitzer-Prize winner Alice Walker, longtime San Francisco resident Maya Angelou and the novelist and poet Ishmael Reed. California's vital Hispanic community - instrinsically tied by language, culture and history to neighboring Mexico, has given readers the voices of Gary Soto, Richard Rodriguez and others. Similarly, California's numerous writers of Asian - American descent look not to Europe for inspiration but to the nations of the Pacific-rim. Representitive among them are Maxine Hong Kingston, Amy Tan and Jessica Hagedorn.

It was largely through Gernsback's various pulp magazines (such as Amazing Stories) that science fiction took hold in the United States. The awards were first given at the 1953 World SF Convention. The awards were dropped the next year. However, since 1955 they have been given annually in various categories (only book-related awards are included below). The Hugo is thought of as a fan award, as voting for the distinction is by those individuals attending the annual WorldCon convention. 1996 Novel: The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson Novella: "The Death of Captain Future" by Allen Steele Novelette: "Think like a Dinosaur" by James Patrick Kelly Short Story: "The Lincoln Train" by Maureen F.

Für weitere Informationen können Sie uns entweder direkt kontaktieren oder das Formular am Ende des Textes verwenden. Um im Rahmen einer typischen "mechatronischen Systemlösung" Signale aus der Fertigungsumgebung aufzunehmen und nach entsprechender Informationsverarbeitung gewünschte Reaktionen des Fertigungssystems zu aktivieren, bedarf es geeigneter Sensoren und nachgeschalteter intelligenter Signalauswerteeinheiten. Innerhalb des Arbeitsbereiches "Sensorik" beschäftigen sich verschiedene Arbeitsgruppen mit Themenstellungen wie Meßwerterfassung, Sensorsystementwicklung, Sensorsignalverarbeitung, multisensorielle Datenverarbeitung, Sensorsimulation etc. um technische Voraussetzungen für eine praxisorientierte Nutzung dieser Entwicklungsergebnisse zur Verfügung zu stellen. Speziell bei der Prozeßsteuerung spielt die Berücksichtigung zeitlicher Kriterien bei der Meßwerterfassung und Auswertung der Sensorsignale für eine einwandfreie Zuordnung der gewonnenen Daten zwecks Rückführung in ein Steuerungssystem eine wesentliche Rolle. Zur Gewährleistung der Echtzeitfähigkeit sollte daher die Verzögerungszeit, bedingt durch die Auswertung der Signale, bis zur Reaktion möglichst gering gehalten werden. Dementsprechend bildet der Aspekt der zeitlichen Anforderungen einen wesentlichen Schwerpunkt im Arbeitsbereich Sensorsignalverarbeitung.

For further information please reply to us the form at the end of this document or contact us directly. The standard manufacturing robot is not capable of detecting on-line changes in the geometry of workpieces or to get information about unforeseen states of workpiece handling or system failure without the use of sensor technology. Especially in flexible workcells designed for small batch production it is necessary that the cell controller is able to react on all possible states of the manufacturing system, i.e. changes of the workpiece position, spatial differences of workpieces and common conditions of the manufacturing environment. Within several research projects sensors for that purpose have been realised and evaluated in industry environments. The aim was to ensure low tolerances of the manufactured workpiece, while considering the simultaneous integration of mostly different manufacturing technologies like arc welding and spot welding in parallel. This required a high degree of flexibility with regard to the performance of the sensor systems and the sensing tasks to be achieved. Especially for process control, the time required for signal sampling and evaluation has a significant influence on the quality of the manufacturing process. Short reaction cycles are a must for for sensor integration. Subsequently, the development of fast and powerful real time signal sampling/processing hardware and software can be considered to be one of ECM mayor objectives in the area of sensorics.

For further information please reply to us the form at the end of this document or contact us directly. The development of innovative mobile service robots as well as the adaption of standard industrial handling systems for specific production tasks are the mayor working areas of the ECM in the field of advanced robotics. Keywords of the current research efforts are system mobility future control systems integration of smart sensors application of knowledge based modules implementation of autonomous functions improved programming tools and last but not least the realisation of future robot generations, like climbing, walking and diving systems The physical restrictions of mankind often do not allow the operation of humans under harming working conditions, like poluted or radioactive areas. Therefore, the development of mobile robot systems operating under water, in the air or on the land is becoming more and more important. To assure a safe autonomous operation of the platforms, they must be equipped with intelligent sensors for the specific task to be solved, e.g. navigation, local path planning etc. Please send us additional information to the following areas: Area of interest Company  Name     Position Street   State      - ZC  City Phone      Fax email        WT03-B25-30IA008-000084-B024-246http://thor.aps.rwth-aachen.de:80/ecm/projekt/ab5_e.htm 137.226.180.78 19970222102603 text/html 2622HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsMIME-Version: 1.0Server: CERN/3.0Date: Saturday, 22-Feb-97 09:00:14 GMTContent-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 2416Last-Modified: Thursday, 28-Mar-96 17:11:05 GMT Man/Machine Interfaces Man/Machine Interfaces The following overview provides a first description of our work carried out in the area of Man/Machine Interfaces. For further information please reply to us the form at the end of this document or contact us directly. The communication interface between the user and the application, e.g. workcell, must be regarded as one of the most important entities in terms of workcell productivity and safety. Concequently, the old fashioned button panel for machine control more and more is replaced with intelligent dialogue modules. 3d graphical simulations, digital video, speech processing or multimedea networking present only a small variety of the tools of a modern man/machine interface. The task of such an interface is not only the provision of an easy to handle control system, but furthermore the support of the user during the operation of the machine. This implies issues like workcell programming, process data supervision or production cycle optimisation. At the European Centre for Mechatronics, currently an interactive vision system is under elaboration. A virtual image of the workcell will be presented to the user, who then can perform specific tasks in the workcell using existing tools like data gloves or tracking modules. The tasks carried out by the user are transformed into the cooresponding workcell programm which then is carried out by the robot cell.

Eine Trennung des Menschen vom Produktionsprozeß hätte jedoch über die technischen Probleme hinausgehend unerwünschte gesellschaftliche Folgen. Drastisch steigende Arbeitslosenzahlen wären hier sicherlich nur als Spitze des Eisberges zu nennen. Eine in ganz Europa stattfindende Diskussion führte deshalb in den letzten Jahren zu der Erkenntnis, daß der menschliche Benutzer, also der Arbeiter, ein fester Bestandteil jeder Anlage für die automatisierte Fertigung sein muß. APS Mechatronik hat sich bereits frühzeitig darauf spezialisiert, moderne Kommunikation- und Informationstechnologien in klassische Produktionszellen zu integrieren, um die Arbeit sicherer und einfacher zu gestalten und gleichzeitig die Aufgabenstellung für den Arbeiter interessanter zu gestalten. Es ist Grundsatz der APS, daß die Produktionsausrüstung dem Arbeiter angepaßt werden muß und nicht umgekehrt. Der Computer als Symbol der Informationsgesellschaft ist hierzu ein maßgebliches Werkzeug. Um die Bedeutung von Computersteuerung und Vernetzung für moderne Produktionsausrüstung anschaulich zu machen, haben wir ein Spiel gewählt: Fußball. Jeder hat schon einmal versucht, den Ball in die zwei Löcher einer Torwand zu schießen. Erstaunlich ist, wie einfach diese Aufgabe von einem Menschen erledigt wird, der dazu lediglich sein Augenmaß und die Muskeln in Bein und Fuß benötigt. Ein Industrieroboter kann ein Werkzeug in ähnlicher Weise bewegen wie der Mensch seinen Fuß. Was dem Roboter jedoch fehlt ist das "Ballgefühl". Warum also nicht das menschliche Können benutzen, um dem Roboter zu zeigen, wie der Ball geschossen wird? Die Kombination der Fähigkeiten von Mensch und Roboter ist die einfache Idee, die hinter Roger, dem Robot Goal Getter, steht. Ein kleiner Sensor mißt die Stellung des Fußes während der Schußbewegung. Diese Daten werden zu einem PC übertragen, der das Herzstück der Installation darstellt. Ein speziell entworfenes Programm berechnet die Trittstärke und die Beschleunigung des Fußes und überträgt diese charakteristischen Eigenschaften des Schusses an den Roboter. Der Spieler entscheidet somit, wie der Ball geschossen wird. Als zusätzliche Option stellt der Rechner den Anwender bei nicht plausiblen Sensorwerten eine benutzerfreundliche Schnittstelle zur manuellen Steuerung des Roboters zur Verfügung. In diesem Fall hat der Benutzer die Möglichkeit, auf bestehendes Expertenwissen einer Datenbank zurückzugreifen. Roger ist eine Spiel-Anwendung, in der Computertechnologie und Datenübertragung verschiedene Module zu einer Einheit integrieren und dem Menschen eine Kommunikation mit der Maschine ermöglichen. Welche Vorteile bringt der Einsatz von Informationstechnologien dem Anwender für industrielle Fertigungsaufgaben? Systemintegration und Anpassung der Maschinenführung an die Bedürfnisse des menschlichen Benutzers sind die zwei Schlüsselthemen.

By Paul Mills Nutro Machinery Corporation Strongsville, Ohio If a company is seriously considering a robot for its painting operation, there are two questions to answer. Is a paint robot truly the right automation choice for the application? If so, how would a robot impact the painting system's overall design and operation? Spray painting methods are categorized into the three most common types: Manual. A human operator with a spray gun. Hard Automation. Spray guns affixed to stationary gun arms or systems such as reciprocators, spinning guns or two- or three-axis positioners. Robot. Generally a six-axis programmable device capable of complex arm and wrist motion. Many times a robot is suggested as the answer to a painting problem; however, this often happens without sufficient analysis of application requirements. Although robots are now faster, more flexible and easier to program, they are not the only or best solution for every application. Sometimes users are so fascinated with a robot that they do not examine whether their parts can be painted more quickly and inexpensively with a less exotic technique. Part Shape. Complex parts with recesses, curved surfaces and picture-frame-like qualities are great candidates for a robot. Others, such as flat sheet panels or those having simple geometry are handled easily with less expensive mechanisms. If keeping the spray gun normal to the part surface requires a great deal of articulation, then a robot is a consideration. Part Variety. The variety of part shapes and sizes bears greatly on how best to paint them. A low-volume job shop where no two painted parts are the same would be a poor location for a robot. Robots handle a range of dissimilar parts painted at high production rates. For example, some automotive manufacturers require finishers to paint all plastic trim parts synchronously for better color matching. This is an ideal application for a robot. Hard automation is a good solution for painting smaller sets of similar parts. A good illustration is an application where a small adjustment can allow a few fixed guns to spray both 15- and 16-inch diameter aluminum wheels. By adding upstream sensing equipment, hard automation accommodates a mixture of parts at a relatively low cost. However, future requirements may tip the balance in favor of robots if new parts, or styling changes would be difficult to achieve by adding or repositioning guns. Cycle Time. A robot's quickness can be misleading. Since a robot moves faster than a gun applies paint, it is the painting speed that is the most significant factor. While robots can be outfitted with only one or two spray guns, it is common to have many spray guns in a hard automation system, allowing more paint to be applied in less time. A good example of the difference in cycle time is the application of ceramic glaze to sanitary ware. Glazing robots using two spray guns require 70 seconds per piece because of the large amount of glaze that must be applied. With hard automation, a rate of 180 pieces an hour (or a 20-second cycle) is accomplished by using more than 20 spray guns on a variety of telescoping and fixed gun stands. Line speed also plays an important role in the cycle time calculation, since a robot only paints the part as it passes through the work envelope. Another consideration is that some finishes require a high film thickness. A robot can use a complex spray path, alternately spraying different areas of the part to build film thickness without runs or sags. A spray test determines the time required to achieve proper coverage and film build. However, a robot alone may not paint fast enough. The solution may be a hybrid system using fixed or moving guns to lay down paint on some surfaces and a robot to handle more difficult areas. Capital and Operating Costs. According to robot suppliers, the top reason for purchasing paint robots is to eliminate labor costs. But to conclude that replacing people with robots will always save money is too simplistic. For single-shift operations where painting involves a low volume of parts that would require hundreds of programs, a robot may be too expensive to justify. Similarly, robots are often costly compared with hard automation solutions. A high-quality reciprocator might cost $15,000 and a robot more than $100,000. A $100,000 robot that replaces a $30,000 worker per shift, three shifts a day, quickly pays for itself; however, a great deal of automation can be purchased for far less than $100,000. When considering the cost of a robot, remember to include not only the cost of the basic robotic unit, but the additional expenses of integrating it into the paint system. These include items such as teach handles, protective covers, documentation, training, tool holders and interface electronics. Some manufacturers estimate the cost of an integrated robot at 30-50 pct over the cost of a basic robot. Paint Savings. A person can paint as accurately as a machine, but it is the repeatability of automated spraying that saves paint. Once a robot is programmed, it coats millions of parts with little variation. Human operators tend to be less consistent and efficient with paint. It is surprising to see how often they trigger a gun to "make sure" it works, which adds up to a significant paint waste. It is also interesting how manual touch-up in one area inevitably results in overspray in another. For specific operations, hard automation is even more efficient than a robot. Spray guns on a gun positioner are triggered precisely to apply paint in high-speed applications with almost no overspray. Hard automation systems paint even complex profiles inexpensively when using automatic masking. Spraying less paint saves money, but it also means less maintenance, cleanup, lower filter costs and VOC emissions. There is an estimated 25-30 pct paint savings for automated systems when compared to human operators. Technical Expertise. Adding complexity to a paint line carries some risk. The standard maintenance toolbox may not help when a robot malfunctions. Troubleshooting and repairing robots requires special training and a degree of sophistication not found in many smaller plants. When evaluating labor savings achieved by replacing manual painters, also consider the training and technical support needed to keep the robot working properly. Selecting a Robot Type. Painting robots are available in either hydraulic or electronic designs. Hydraulic robots were once the dominant machines used in painting applications. Today, they comprise most of the used robot business, but are greatly outnumbered by electronic counterparts. While they offer high load capability, this is less vital in paint applications where one or two spray guns do not present serious weight problems. Hydraulic systems provide simpler solutions for meeting explosion-proof standards, since power cables to electronic servo motors can be eliminated. Their primary advantage is as a lower cost alternative to electronic robots. Electronic paint robots use high-speed, precision electric servo drives for movement. They achieve faster movement and more precise positioning than hydraulic units. Without the need for hydraulic connections, electronic robots are also more modular and require less mechanical maintenance. Both robot types require attention to cleanliness and proper preventive maintenance, as well as a well-trained, and technically knowledgeable support staff. The type chosen for a particular application will depend on the specific operational parameters and budgetary considerations. Testing. Before purchasing any robot paint system it is important to test its ability to paint the required parts. Such a test can reveal the expected cycle time; the complexity of the programming task; and the precision required for workholder design. A good finishing systems house will have the ability to set up a test and demonstrate this capability. Coating Material Compatibility. The coating material may dictate some limitations. Ceramic glaze and porcelain enamel, for example, are destructive to the sensitive mechanisms found in many wrist designs. Robots spraying solvent-borne material must adhere to explosion-proof electrical requirements. This necessitates wiring suitable for hazardous locations for connections to the robot. Robots intended for liquid paint applications usually feature air purge systems to meet these safety requirements. In powder applications, it is sometimes necessary to add additional protection to prevent powder from migrating into critical robot components. Rubberized boots placed over servo motors and kept under positive air pressure will help prevent powder related failures. Load Restrictions. Make certain that the robot is able to hold all the required equipment throughout the operating cycle. Robot payload specifications should reference a payload at a known offset. Speed. While it may be tempting to want the fastest robot available, it is important to consider the maximum speed at which paint can be applied. Typically, pattern distortion occurs around five ft per second, so a robot that can move faster has limited benefit for spraying. Again, a spray test to determine cycle time for your part, coverage and film build is an important first step. The Work Envelope. The work envelope, dictated by the reach of the robot (less the combination of gun and wrist distance when spraying inward), determines the maximum part size. In continuous conveyor systems where the robot tracks the conveyor, the work envelope limits the maximum cycle time for each part. Most manufacturers provide detailed information regarding the physical work envelope of their robots. In some cases, the robot can reach below its own base. For a floor-mounted robot this provides no benefit, but mounting the robot on a pedestal will extend the reach of the robot considerably, providing greater flexibility. The Conveyor. The robot expects a part to be presented in a well-defined position. Therefore, the robot must know where the part is and how fast it is moving. A limit switch tripped by the workholder triggers a signal to the robot controller. Placing this switch outside the spray booth allows the robot to paint the part as it enters the spray booth. Conveyors typically fall into two categories: indexing or continuous running. Indexing systems move a part into position, stop, then the robot sprays the part. These conveyors are programmed to achieve the required cycle time and provide smooth acceleration and deceleration. However, an indexing system provides the simplest means to paint the part since it is not a moving target. During dwell time, the part can be rotated in place. Continuous running systems require hardware and software to inform the robot about the part position as it moves. Encoders are commonly used for this. Relative, or incremental encoders on conveyor drive shafts calculate the conveyor position from a known "home" position. This digital timing information is sent to the robot controller. Once the robot control receives the information, the software calculates the appropriate translation of the robot's coordinates. The robot can then "track" the part using these changing coordinates. Part Fixtures. A person's eyes, brain and hands work together to correct for the unexpected. If a part is slightly askew, a spray painter can compensate for the problem. Since the robot is "blind," it assumes that the part is oriented in a specific way consistent with its stored painting program. An improperly positioned part will not be painted correctly. Because of this, the workholder should present parts in a uniform, precise manner. Bent spindles, swaying hangers, slippage or poorly racked parts cause quality problems. Attachments should provide stability to limit rack swaying and rotational movement. Where rack rotation is required, positive engagement of a sprocket or star-indexer assures that the rack turns smoothly and predictably. An accurate chain-driven rotator with variable-speed motor provides smoother and more reliable rotation than simple belt-driven systems. A locating pin attached to the sprocket serves as an electronic "flag." When this is detected with a photoelectric sensor or proximity switch, the spinner turns the part until the pin's presence is sensed. The spinner is then stopped in the desired position. The rack should be designed in a way that rigidly fixes the orientation of the part along all axes. Communications. In robot paint systems, bi-directional communication needs to be established between the robot controller and the system PLC. Usually a start command passes from the PLC to the robot. While the start command could be delivered directly from the sensors to the robot controller, other events are often triggered from the same signal, such as the pneumatic solenoids. On systems where different parts are painted, a part ID is also provided to the robot controller so that the right paint program is executed. Operators enter the part ID into a keypad terminal as parts are loaded onto the system. In more automated systems bar-code readers or vision systems are used. The system PLC tracks each part and its ID through shift registers as it travels through the system. The robot controller also communicates back to the PLC with status information on the robot and its purge system, as well as fault conditions such as over-travel limits and other problems. Collision Avoidance. The robot manufacturer usually provides several means to avoid collisions. In some robots, an internal rubber bumper is placed at the extremes of motion. A second level of protection is a software limitation. The robot controller is programmed with a horizon that becomes a boundary for the painting program. This is intended to prohibit programming the robot to an unsafe position. Finally, a limit switch in the robot provides a mechanism to disable the robot entirely if the other mechanisms are defeated or fail. Spray Booth Design. The first consideration of the spray booth design is whether the robot can fit into the booth. Robots need ample clearance to paint within the designated work envelope. Often the booth needs to be much wider and deeper than a standard automatic booth. Allow sufficient room around the robot for access to components requiring periodic maintenance. Whenever possible, provide observation windows to monitor robot operation. Robots can operate in an environment heavier in contaminants. A recirculating ventilation system allows the booth air to be used longer before turnover, sending less air that is more VOCs concentrated to the abatement system. This lowers abatement costs and presents fewer regulatory problems. Recirculating booths also require less air make-up. In environmentally controlled booths, this means less expense for heating and air-conditioning make-up air. Path Programming. Most electric painting robots offer several means of programming the spray path. Point-to-Point Programming. Movements are programmed by entering the coordinates of each successive point. Beginning from a home position, the robot is programmed as to which direction and how far to move to the next point. Along with the move, the program instructs the spray gun to spray or not. This type of programming is slow and tedious for complex paths requiring many interim steps. Ordinarily, this type of programming is performed using a teach pendant, which is a small hand-held electronic console that can be brought into the spray booth for programming. Lead-Through Programming. Many robots allow the programmer to physically move the robot arm through a path while the robot controller memorizes the movement. This is a quick way to program the path. The program can then be refined with additional point-to-point instructions. A teach handle is required to accomplish lead-through programming. The teach handle is outfitted with buttons to toggle the recording off and on and to make movement of the robot arm easier. Off-Line Programming. With some robots, painting is simulated off-line with graphic three-dimensional operator interfaces. The path is executed, evaluated and fine-tuned off-line so that system downtime is minimized and greater transfer efficiency is achieved. Much development is currently taking place to enhance these programs so that a CAD (Computer Aided Design) drawing of the part can be imported, and a self-optimizing routine that creates the most efficient spray path. Many systems permit programming various spray parameters, color changes and entering analog values for atomization air, fan air, and flow rates.  Gun Mounting. Spray guns should be mounted for easy removal for repair and maintenance. The mounting should also hold the gun rigidly in a preset position, since the paint program is based on a known spray gun position. Care should be taken to avoid damage to fluid delivery and air hoses. Gun Cleaning. Most robots are integrated into systems that use a variety of colors. The robot can be programmed to clean the spray gun for either periodic maintenance or color changes by spraying the gun into a purge bucket. Robot Safety. Robots, driven by powerful electric motors, have caused injuries and even deaths. To prevent accidents, spray booth doors should have safety interlocks to stop the robot whenever the booth door is opened. Particular caution should be exercised when programming the robot. In one instance, an operator was pinned against a spray booth wall and crushed to death by a robot because he had defeated the safety switch on the teach pendant. Also, use caution when programming robot movement, especially "tool coordinates." Tool coordinates are referenced from the spray gun tip, which constantly changes with respect to absolute coordinates in the spray booth. Because of this, programmers have experienced unexpected results when programming in tool coordinates due to the difficulty in keeping track of changing reference frames. The choice of technology for painting parts depends upon a number of technical and economic factors. A broad range of solutions from manual spray stations to multi-robot installations is available. Using sophisticated interfaces and fast, precise motion systems, hard automation and robotics provide significant advantages for many spray paint jobs. Sometimes the best solution is a combination of technologies. There is no substitute for putting together a knowledgeable team from the start. This team should include the paint supplier, application equipment supplier and a turnkey systems house familiar with all aspects of integrating a painting robot into a complete finishing system. When robots are used, careful thought should be given to the overall system design to accommodate and maximize the robot's benefits. Part fixturing, conveyor design, system PLC selection, spray booth design, programming tools and safety systems should all be engineered with the robot in mind.

By Brent Lee, Ph.D. Vacuum Plating Technology Corporation San Jose, California Building hardware manufacturers formed a pilot production program to test the applicability of physical vapor deposition (PVD) for their parts. Several of these hardware manufacturers had previously tested the technology and found more reasons not to use the process than reasons to use it. Arc plasma physical vapor deposition (PVD/ARC) is a vacuum plating technique where metal vapor in highly ionized plasma is generated by use of electric arcs. Reactive deposition of titanium nitride (TiN) and titanium carbide (TiC) are presently the most common applications. The most extensive research and widely implemented application of arc deposited plating is as a wear-resistant finish on cutting and forming tools. TiN coatings also have a rich color that closely simulates brass or real gold. With the combination of abrasion resistance, corrosion resistance and attractive color, TiN plated surfaces open up many new applications in consumer-oriented products. The objectives of the pilot program were 1) To provide an excellent finish and lifetime warranty for consumers, and 2) To eliminate some of the toxic chemicals from the plating process. Because of the improvements in PVD, the cost of production is estimated to be lower than that of electroplating. Physical vapor deposition technology has helped high-tech industries because, unlike conventional plating methods, the deposited material is a metal or alloy. No toxic chemicals are involved in the process. However, some of the major problems associated with the PVD process are the restricted size and shape of the components and slow production rates. Improvements in the technology, using cathodic arc plasma (CAP) technology, provided a high deposition and ionization rate as well as low-temperature operation. In the pilot program, the supplier provided coated square panel plates for manufacturers to test. The manufacturers carried out their own tests on these panels. When the results were positive, the manufacturers sent the supplier a small quantity of components for further testing. Manufacturers were cautious before purchasing any PVD equipment, even after sample testing, components testing and plant visits. However, their confidence was eventually won. Technology. CAP is a branch of physical vapor deposition technology used for decorative coating. Various metallurgical thin films combat wear, chemical corrosion, and protect against high temperatures and the environment. CAP deposits compounds such as nitrides, oxides, carbides and mixtures. Some of the coatings most frequently used are TiN (titanium nitride), TiC (titanium carbide), ZrN (zirconium nitride), CrN (chromium nitride), their mixtures, and sometimes, with multi-layers. In the CAP deposition process, part of the cathode is evaporated by the action of vacuum arcs. The basic components consist of a vacuum chamber, cathode assemblies, arc power supply systems, bias power supply, control panels, water-cooling system, compressed-air supply system, and a vacuum pumping system. A typical system has eight cathodes. This system includes a vacuum chamber, cathode assemblies and vacuum pumping system. The chamber's interior dimensions are 40 by 60 inches. This system has eight cathodes in order to achieve optimum uniformity of coating. Coating chamber. The coating chamber is made of stainless steel with a double wall for water cooling. A front door for loading and unloading also provides access for cleaning and maintenance. Two view ports are mounted on the front door for visual inspection. A shutter behind the view port keeps the glass window clean during operation. Cathodes are mounted on either side of the chamber wall. The back of the coating chamber is connected to the pumping system. The fixturing system, including a planetary rotation system for racks, is mounted on the top. Pumping system. The pumping system consists of two mechanical pumps, one base pump, two diffusion pumps and a series of pipes and valves that connect the pumps together with the coating chamber. Pumping is done in three stages. First, the mechanical pumps pump the chamber to low vacuum (rough pumping). Second, the base pump then will pump to chamber to medium vacuum. The base pump adds efficiency and pumping speed. Finally, the diffusion pumps will pump the chamber to high vacuum. The mechanical pumps also serve as a backup pump for the base and diffusion pump, which is the high-vacuum pump. Fixturing system. The planetary rotation system supports six fixturing posts and is driven by a variable-speed motor. The planetary system provides two degrees of motion for each of the fixturing posts, self-spinning as well as circling around the chamber. Consequently, uniform coating is achieved. The automatic pressure controller maintains a constant gas pressure in the chamber during deposition. Two gas channels are allowed for argon and nitrogen. A thermocouple thermal gage is used for low-vacuum measurement, and an ion gage is used for high vacuum measurement. Both readings are shown on the controller display. Bias power controller. A bias power supply provides electrical potential bias between the cathodes and the substrates. As a result, the charged particles emitted from the cathodes will gain acceleration from the electric field and deposit onto the substrate with high kinetic energy. This kinetic energy turns into bonding power, which ensures good adhesion. Local area arcing due to out-gassing on the substrate surface during deposition may damage the quality of the coating. The bias power controller has an arc suppression circuit to minimize local area arcing. An arc-power-circuit-supply controller for the cathodes has eight sets of controllers, one for each cathode. Three parameters are displayed and can be adjusted: the current of the cathode, arc restarted with automatic restart circuit, and water cooling for cathodes. The voltage between the anode and cathode is about 20v depending on the anode-cathode configuration. To sustain the arcing, the minimum current is about 40 amps and 60 amps for titanium and zirconium, respectively. Low current is preferred for fine-grain-size deposit. The drawback of low current is that the arc spots traveling on the surface of the target are not stable and extinguish easily. This arc can be restarted automatically. Maintaining high-quality coating consistently requires a reasonable control of the coating room environment. Humidity, temperature and particulate levels within the coating facility affect the cleanliness of the parts to be coated. Specification of the cleaning equipment, materials and procedures for preparing the parts for finishing is critical to ensure quality. Table I outlines the coating performance specifications as required by the Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association, Inc. in ANSI/BHMA A 156.5-1992, intended for organic coatings. Also listed in Table I is the required performance of vacuum deposited coatings. To test the performance of the CAP systems, numerous runs were used to test the uniformity of the coating characteristics within each part and from part to part as well as throughout the chamber and from run to run. These tests were performed on small, medium, and large parts. The team members of the pilot program were able to coat products that passed all the tests within the time frame set by the manufacturers. Some disagreement on cleaning procedure in the early stage of the program caused some coating failure. However, once the correct cleaning procedure was used, coatings applied using PVD equipment exceeded the specifications with TiN test (see Table I). To avoid future misunderstanding with customers regarding the cleaning process, a substrate pretreatment system was designed specifically for PVD deposition. Thin TiN coatings are producing dramatic increases in tool life and productivity in numerous industrial applications. The flexibility of the process, its capability to deposit metals at high rates, and the qualities of the finish, make PVD/ARC an attractive low-cost, high-quality surface finish for decorative hardware.

By Beverly A. Graves, Editor Rawac Plating Co., Springfield, Ohio, bought a used plating machine and gave it new life. With the help of its next door neighbor, Corrotec, Inc., Rawac was able to resurrect the giant machine and make it a first class zinc plating line. It all started when Dave Stratton of Corrotec called Dave Fail of Rawac and asked if he would be interested in a used plating line. Considering that several competing businesses in the Springfield area were leaving or closing, Mr. Fail and his boss, Art Gianakopoulos, decided it would be a good investment. However, simply moving the line into the building was not the answer. Rawac had to build an addition to its existing facility to accommodate the new line. This allowed Corrotec to assist in the setup and layout of the new building, as well as make recommendations about the floor, dikes, secondary containment and waste treatment facilities. The line became a marriage of old and new. The used line was coupled with new programming, heaters, rectifiers, washer, dryer and conveyor line. A prewash system was added also to the line to help remove the variety of oils and soils that come in on parts. "Each manufacturer uses a different oil, it seems," noted Mr. Fail. "We needed something that would work with all types of soils." Job shops are being confronted with more and different types of soils. There are several theories as to why parts are arriving at job shops with more oils and/or soils on them. One theory is that the demise of vapor degreasing has prompted manufacturers to send dirty parts to the plater for cleanup. Another theory is that manufacturers are changing the oils they use due to environmental regulations. Since there is an array of machining fluids, lubricants and oils, the plater has to find a way to clean all of them off the parts. The prewash system at Rawac is a single-stage process in which parts are impinged with a low concentration (four oz/gal) alkaline cleaner for three min. A gas-fired immersion burner heats the cleaner. Two vertical pumps, producing 150 gph at 60 tdh, pump the solution through risers to nozzles, where parts are sprayed at 300 gpm. This removes 90 pct of all soils before the parts ever reach the cleaners on the zinc plating line. It also keeps the zinc plating baths clean, allowing one to see clear to the bottom of the tank. The prewash system was a solution to problems Rawac had experienced on its other plating lines. The oils from incoming parts were killing the immersion cleaners and, subsequently, additional waste treatment and greater chemical use resulted. There was also added downtime for dumping the cleaner tanks and recharging them with fresh cleaner. The prewash is off-line yet set up adjacent to the plating line. After the loader removes two racks from the plating line it loads two racks from the washer onto the line. The original plating system was designed to plate different size parts than those plated at Rawac. Corrotec rebuilt the load bars to accommodate new parts and heavier racks. All the system controls were converted into programmable logic controls. The system runs from a PLC-basic control system with operator interface. A similar return-type machine was already running at the Rawac facility and was used as the foundation for the new system. The plating line has 44 stations and handles 88 racks at a time. Cycling is just over one min per cycle, producing two racks of parts or 120 racks/hr of plated parts. The plating cycle is listed in Table I. All rinses, except those between the soak and electrocleaner, are countercurrent. In the cleaning tanks, cleaners are pumped from the bottom of the tank and through a ripple pipe to skim off the oils. The recovered oils are sent to a reclaimer. The last rinse in each countercurrent rinse sequence has a flow restriction of five gpm. The total rinse water discharged from the plating line is less than 25 gpm. Water from the line is collected in a large sump and from there is transferred to a sump in the main building. The main building houses an expanded 150 gpm waste treatment system. When Rawac decided to install the zinc plating line, it knew it would have to also consider a larger waste treatment system. First, Rawac purchased a larger clarifier from Lanco Environmental Products. The treatment reactors also were enlarged. The reactor system consists of a series of tanks that elevate the pH to approximately 10, doses it with chemicals and polymers, sends it to the surge tank and then to the clarifier. From the clarifier, wastewater goes through a sludge thickener followed by a filter press for dewatering. Clarified liquid goes to a weir tank and is then discharged to the local POTW. The limit on zinc in Springfield is three ppm. The ventilation system is a 18,500 cfm Duall System scrubber. The hoods and ductwork were rebuilt, along with a new remote recirculating tank and piping. The marriage of used equipment with new was an accomplishment. But Rawac felt it had to make it work in order to stay productive. "There are fewer platers out there today, and with the increase in the demand for productivity and absolute quality, we had to find a way to deliver," stated Mr. Fail. And Rawac did!

He aspired to work in international marketing, but he ended up in plating. How did that happen? His brother introduced him to the founder of Rawac Plating, Foster Compton. Although he did not know much about plating, he started working at Rawac in 1967. In 1970, Mr. Gianakopoulos and his brother purchased Rawac Plating. This was also the beginning of his involvement in the National Association of Metal Finishers (NAMF). Mr. Gianakopoulos attributes the success of his company to his association with others in the plating industry. His active participation in NAMF eventually led to his election as president of the association in 1990. Plating is not his only business. Mr. Gianakopoulos also owns the Kreider Corporation, which specializes in small metal stampings and wire forms. He also acquired Southeastern Sales, a plumbing and heating distributor. In 1989 he purchased the Champion Company, an 111-year-old manufacturer of embalming fluids and other products for the funeral industry. This company has established a division that manufactures steel shipping containers for jet engines and missile parts for the U.S. Government. Not only is Mr. Gianakopoulos involved in business, he is involved in his community as well. He was elected Ohio Employer of the Year of Handicapped Persons and received recognition from the local Mental Health Community for his work helping the handicap. He has handicapped employees that have been working at Rawac for more than 15 years.

However, pretreatment is the most important . . . By David Crotty, Carl Steinecker and Bradley Durkin MacDermid, Inc. Waterbury, Connecticut Surface finishers are often asked to plate difficult substrates. With any plating process, the most interesting subject is the chemistry and subtleties of the deposition process. Pretreatment does not seem to be so interesting. Even in the plating shop, this aspect is often given little attention. However, pretreatment is often the most important procedure. There are many instances where pretreatment seems to be 99 pct of the job and the deposit is almost an afterthought. Most of the cleaners used in the electroplating industry are proprietary, although most suppliers have similar products. Powdered Metal Parts. Many parts are made from powdered steel and steel alloys. The major problem with these parts is derusting and porosity. The surface porosity is partially eliminated using vacuum impregnation. In this process, organic polymers are impregnated into the pores of the part. However, some open pores always remain, resulting in bleed out of pretreatment chemistry after plating. The bleed out often appears as a circular stain, and this may not become evident for some time after plating. The best way to avoid this is to make sure that the pores are filled with clean water before corrosive materials like hydrochloric acid are used in pretreatment. A hot water rinse drives out any solution that may be in the pores. A mild alkaline cleaner derusts the powdered metals. Some derusting cleaners attack the substrate and should be avoided. The same cleaner can be used as a soak cleaner and electrocleaner. In this case, it is always best to use two tanks, because the soak cleaner will remove most of the oils, allowing the electrocleaner to remove the last traces of soils.

Zinc Die Castings. This discussion applies mostly to Zamac 3 and Zamac 7 castings, but other alloys may also be plated this way. The major concern about any metal die castings is the quality of the casting. Flashing and air pockets in the casting can make it impossible to provide a quality coating. Pretreating zinc die castings almost always begins with mechanical surface finishing. In most cases, parts are tumbled in clean media, but various bead-blasting techniques also are used.  Again, the quality of the electroless nickel coating will depend strongly on the quality of the part's surface after this mechanical finishing. The surface is fairly clean after the mechanical steps, but special care must be taken to properly activate the surface. One of the best methods uses a mild phosphoric acid based cleaner. Step one uses the cleaner as provided by the supplier, and step two with the cleaner modified by a bifluoride salt. The key to plating mechanically finished and cleaned die castings is the nickel strike. The nickel strike is prepared in two steps using an alkaline electroless nickel bath. The first step uses the electroless nickel additive containing the nickel and complexors but not the reducing agent. This step provides a semi-bright nickel immersion layer that protects the zinc part from the more aggressive electroless nickel plating process to follow. The second layer is prepared by the full alkaline electroless nickel process. This process may be a phosphorus- or a boron-type process. Often, the best results are from the boron process. Porosity and bleed out may still be a problem with zinc die castings. Warm rinses before plating are seldom used, but may be necessary. Ultrasonics in a mild acid cleaner often is effective in removing soils from the larger pores. An important detail is that no metals can touch the parts. Thus, plastic hooks or racks are absolutely required to fixture the work.

Beryllium is an expensive and toxic material but has found some use in space applications such as mirrors, because the thermal expansion of this material is low. In most cases, parts must be heat treated after plating. This requirement will be specific, but typically involves heating at 325F for four hours, cooling at no more than 100 to 200F per hr and then air cooling to room temperature.

Preparing various wrought and cast alloys of aluminum is fairly standard, (1,2,3,4,5,6) and it would be difficult to do justice to the subject in this space. However, some notes may assist in difficult situations. There are alloys, like 7075, that respond best to an alkaline electroless nickel strike prior to electroless or electrolytic plating. The strike is operated at a low temperature (100-120F) for sufficient time to produce a complete covering of the surface. A dramatic example (7) of a project using this technique is the plating of a 23-ft mirror honored at the 1993 Electroless Nickel Conference sponsored by PRODUCTS FINISHING. Most alloys respond well to alkaline zincate treatments, with a single application for cast alloys and a double application for wrought alloys. However, some alloys, like 413 castings, are attacked strongly by alkaline zincate. In these cases acid zinc immersion is best. The acid zinc immersion may also be recommended for barrel work, since the thin smooth deposit is not damaged by the tumbling as much as the thicker zinc deposit from the alkaline processes. High-silicon alloys also respond best to the acid-zinc immersion process. For this reason, it is important to use a zinc strip process that does not contain nitric acid. The best choice for the zinc strip when using the acid zinc immersion process is persulfate with an inorganic or an organic acid. It is noted in ASTM B656 that heat treating aluminum parts 285-302F after electroless nickel plating improves adhesion. The MIL-C-26074E specification suggests that non-heat treatable aluminum alloys (class 3) should be heated at 360-390F after plating. However, heat treatable alloys (class 4) must be heated at 240-260F after plating. This point is especially important if the electroless nickel is to be heated to increase the hardness of the electroless nickel. The electroless nickel treatment is often 350C (662F), which will alter the properties of some aluminum alloys. Magnesium. Plating magnesium has been a subject of considerable work over the years. Sakata (8) reviewed some of the published methods and provided an alternative. Successful methods use a cyanide copper strike that covers small pores. The major problem with magnesium is that even the smallest pore will become a corrosion site in an acid medium, typical of normal acidic electroless nickels. It results in a black burn site. The situation is more critical than with zinc die castings or powdered metals. Even water in a pore will cause catastrophic corrosion is just a few days, even if a part has been plated successfully without the burn sites. Sakata's method provides pretreatment steps, followed by the Dow zincate, followed by an alkaline nickel citrate electroless strike. Parts can be plated with an alkaline electroless nickel to build up thickness, but it is difficult to use an acidic electroless nickel without some attack on the substrate wherever there is a large pore. However, even under the best conditions, bleed out sites sometimes become apparent after a few days. As a result, plating magnesium without a cyanide copper strike remains a challenge that will require much more research. Engineering Plastics. A variety of engineering plastics has been considered as replacements for aluminum in many applications. Some of these plastics have good high-temperature performance, and all of them are lighter and more corrosion resistant than metals. Some of these plastics include polycarbonate, poly-aryletheretherketone, and poly-etherimide resins. When an application requires conductivity or electrical shielding, the plastic parts must be metallized and electroless nickel is used to accomplish this. The methods for plating some of these materials have been described (9,10,11,12) in other reports. The key to successfully plating these materials involves several issues: 1) The plastic must be plateable. This means that the polymer is filled with glass or other etchable materials, since the pure polymers often do not etch well. 2) Some polymers have a tenacious skin that must be removed by bead blasting or vapor honing. 3) Many of these plastics must be annealed thermally to relieve stress in the part. The temperature and time of the annealing process depend on the type of plastic and the filler. 4) The choice of pre-etch process depends of the nature of the plastic. 5) Certain conditioners before the catalyst can be used to improve adhesion of the metal deposits. After these considerations, the catalyst, electroless nickel or copper strike, electroless copper buildup, and electroless nickel buildup processes are standard. One notable example of an engineering application is the plating of Kapton polyimide film(12,13,14) used in flexible electronic circuits. The cycle includes an alkaline etch for polyimide and an alkaline palladium catalyst. The strike layer is electroless nickel, which is preferred to electroless copper because the copper polyimide bond degrades with time while the nickel polyimide bond does not degrade. Perhaps the greatest challenge facing the surface finisher is preparing various surfaces for electroless nickel plating. The variety of metal and non-metal surfaces mandates that the finisher be ready with considerable knowledge of pretreatment, since even minor variations of the substrate often require significant changes in the pretreatment.

This waste must be collected, stored, transported, analyzed and legally disposed of. There is an alternative, however, recycling. Environmental Purification Industries recycles more than 10,000 tons of waste annually. The recycling processes it uses are approved by the EPA for paint waste recycling. The processes are the DryPure™ System and the Polymeric Recovery System, a new technology. Before waste is accepted, generators must provide an eight-oz sample and a paint waste profile. Technicians test the sample, review the profile and conduct a metals analysis to determine if the material can be processed. Once approved, shipments are off loaded into a hopper for transfer to one of the two recycling systems. The new technology, Polymeric Recovery System (PRS) handles waste once considered non-recyclable, such as epoxy resins, latex paints and inks. These can be processed and reused by the same industries that produced them. For example, the paint on a car contains components similar to those in underbody sealants. Using a low-heat process, the PRS recaptures these resins. First, a quality analysis is performed to determine what additives need to be introduced into the sludge to control its final physical properties. The mixture is pumped into a reactor and processed for several hours under vacuum and low heat, less than 300F. All vapors and liquids are removed and condensed. The dehydrated, gray, putty-like material left behind is pumped from the reactor and tested for quality assurance. This uncured resin is finally formed into 30 lb units for packaging. The final product, EPI-MERTM is sold back to the industry that created it for use in caulks, adhesives, rubber compounds and the sealants that undercoat cars. The company provides a Recycling Certificate that guarantees that the waste delivered was recycled into a safe, useful product. Source: Environmental Purification Industries, Inc., Toledo, Ohio.

For 35 years Tomlinson Industries, Garfield Heights, Ohio, has plated with the same continuous fixed-cycle return machine. Recently, it increased its plating flexibility and reduced its reject rate from 10 to two pct by replacing the old equipment with a computer-controlled hoist system. Tomlinson employs 175 people and is a world leader in the manufacture of liquid-food dispensing valves used in tea, coffee, beer and wine dispensers. The company exports more than 25 pct of its products to 70 countries worldwide. The company holds an E-Star Award from the U.S. Department of Commerce for maintaining its level of export business. Tomlinson is also in the process of obtaining ISO 9000 certification. As part of the process, employees are trained to hand-inspect each valve. As a captive nickel-chrome plating shop, the company plates more than 1,000 different parts in small quantities. Brass, aluminum and steel are plated at the facility. Brass parts undergo aqueous cleaning, a priming brass soak, secondary brass soak, electrocleaning and an acid salt cleaning. Steel parts have only one soak cleaning, which is followed by an electrocleaning and acid salt cleaning. The aluminum parts are ultrasonically cleaned, soak cleaned, acid salt cleaned and then zincated. All parts receive a nickel strike and are then nickel and chromium plated. Choosing a New Machine. When the time came to replace the aging return machine, Tomlinson considered three options: purchase a new return machine; purchase a rebuilt return machine; or purchase a computer-controlled hoist system. After researching all the options, Tomlinson invested in a turnkey plating system from Atotech USA that included a hoist, computer controls, auxiliary equipment and installation. The company designed a new plating room to accommodate the system, which allowed Tomlinson to keep the return machine running until the new system was operational. Problems with the Return Machine. Ken Sidoti, plant engineer for Tomlinson, cited flexibility as the key factor for replacing the dedicated return machine. Cycle changeover was time consuming and labor intensive with the return machine. Changing from brass to aluminum or steel substrates involved stopping the machine, unloading the parts, manually pretreating them, and re-racking. This transition cycle averaged 20 min. Computer-Controlled Hoist Offers Flexibility. The Atotech computer-controlled hoist has transition cycles that allow instant changeover from one base-metal cycle to another, with minimum production loss. The machine is programmed to know which parts to pick up and which tanks to put them in, based on operator selection. "Flexibility and reliability are key to scheduling our jobs," explained Mr. Sidoti. "Now, at the flip of a switch we can changeover to the nickel cycle in eight min rather than 16 min." Plant Manager Jim Leigh agreed. "One huge benefit is the ability to incorporate a cleaning cycle for the three different base metals into the automatic machine, which results in higher quality parts and a significantly lower scrap rate." An added benefit was derived from the machine because products that were sent to an outside supplier for clear anodizing are now chromium-plated in-house on the hoist system. Tomlinson expects a three-year return-on-investment, according to Leigh. "This system does everything we asked for. We couldn't be more pleased." After 35 years Tomlinson decided to make a change and found it to be both flexible and profitable.

His editorial noted that October of 1971 marked the magazine's 35th year covering the finishing industry. I did some quick, easy math and realized that 1996 marks PF's 60th anniversary. Don Gardner, founder of Gardner Publications, published the first issue of Products Finishing in October 1936. In the issue, Mr. Gardner stated that the magazine would "assume the task of searching out and disseminating the newest and best information available concerning metal finishing, in all its various ramifications." In 1971, Mr. Poll re-dedicated that magazine to the continued fulfillment of that promise. I continued my research of 1971. Then environmental regulations were knocking at the door. The January 1971 issue featured a story on Proctor-Silex in Altoona, Pennsylvania. The company installed a system that would accept toxic wastes (chromium, nickel, acids and alkalis) from its plating line and release a "harmless, clear effluent to a stream." Another "new" topic was powder coating. The first powder coating conference was held in February 1971. The April issue provided 22 answers to the question "Why Powder Coat?" In the article, Ford Motor Company's Gilbert L. Burnside stated, "I believe powder coating will go. And I think it would go even if we did not have air pollution to contend with." And it has. And advertising has changed as well. In 1971 many ads featured scantily clad women. You will not see that in the magazine in 1996. There are more women in the industry and the "Good Old Boy" attitude has faded. Since 1936 and 1971, there has been much activity in the finishing industry. Despite all this activity, environmental regulations, energy shortages, recessions and prosperity, the finishing community has remained close. Associations cooperate, finishers collaborate and even finishing magazines work together. You've heard the saying, the more things change, the more they remain the same. Again, Products Finishing re-dedicates itself to fulfilling Don Gardner's promise.

When backlogged orders for corrugated box equipment piled up, executives at United Container Machinery went in search of a finishing system that could keep up with demand. What they found not only solved the production dilemma, it significantly improved quality, reduced VOC emissions and lowered finishing costs. Located in Glen Arm, Maryland, United is a leading supplier of container machinery. The company's innovative history includes more than a century of pioneering advancements, beginning with the creation of the first rotary press for printing on wood in 1892. In the decades that followed, the company was recognized for other developments in corrugated machinery and was able to weather periods of high and low demand through production adjustments. Today, with increased orders for its line of corrugators, rotary slitters, die cutters, scorers and glue machines, United has put its 152,000 sq ft Glen Arm plant into high gear. Production has been expanded from one to three shifts, and its work force has burgeoned to nearly 500. This phenomenal growth tested the abilities of the plant's manufacturing process. Soon, it became apparent to Marc Childs, production superintendent, that the plant's finishing system was not capable of handling the increased orders and was hampering efficiency and output. Painters struggled to keep up with orders, machine assemblers rushed to meet customer delivery deadlines, and the manufacturing department was plagued by repeated adjustments to the production schedule. Analyzing the Problem. With additional growth anticipated, Mr. Childs felt it was important to carefully study all factors involved with the finishing process before making any changes. He did not want a quick fix that would likely become a problem a few years later. Conversely, he did not want to invest in an elaborate finishing system that would never be fully utilized. His search for answers began with a review of the relationship between the finishing system and the manufacturing process. Tracking the flow of material through the plant, it was obvious to Mr. Childs that the finishing system regulated machine assembly. All of the company's products had components that were painted after fabrication. So, when finishing fell behind, assembly was also delayed. The finishing system was common for machine manufacturers. Fabricated steel components were cleaned, sanded if necessary, masked and sprayed in a vented booth. The parts were removed from the booth and placed on the shop floor to air-dry. Drying averaged eight to 10 hrs, limiting painting to one shift. Even when the painted components were dry enough to handle for assembly, they were often not fully cured, causing touch-ups to become the norm, not the exception. Quality was another big concern of  Mr. Childs. United had earned a reputation for exceptional service and reliable machinery. To achieve the high standards the customer had come to expect, a number of quality control steps were incorporated at the plant, including the establishment of criteria for acceptable finish quality. Although pleased with the durability and corrosion and chemical resistance of the coating systems, Mr. Childs was less impressed with their appearance. Gloss variations from machine to machine were common. In addition, the slow air-dry process exposed the coatings to dust and other contaminants, creating finish imperfections. Not all the areas Mr. Childs reviewed involved internal requirements. As with most OEM's, United was battling to reduce VOC emissions to satisfy federal and local environmental regulations. If the plant continued to operate with the same high-solvent, high-VOC coatings that had been used in the past, it would limit the number of machines it could produce annually. Seeking a Solution. The slow air-dry method worked fine when the company was only producing three to four machines per month. However, this was at odds with United's aggressive production schedule. Mr. Childs realized he needed to completely revamp the system in order to keep pace with the company's impressive growth forecast. He also knew it would be difficult to come up with a solution alone. To help, he sought technical assistance from Coating Specialist Frank Burnette of Sherwin-Williams Chemical Coatings group and John Baker of the InfraTherm Division of Binks Manufacturing Company. Messrs. Baker, Burnette and Childs assessed the situation. The group observed that United's finishing area processed a wide range of part sizes, from massive cylinder housings to simple ink reservoir plates. They also noticed significant variations in air quality, temperature and humidity on the shop floor, contributing to the inconsistencies in finish quality. Armed with this and other information, the three proposed a finishing system they felt would meet United's requirements. It eliminated all the company's various coatings and recommended a one-coating system as the standard. Curing would be achieved in a state-of-the-art, custom-designed, gas-fired infrared spray and cure booth. Together, the coating and spray/cure booth were expected to dramatically enhance finish quality, reduce curing time to a little over one hour and lower VOC emissions. The Coating System. The recommended coating system consists of a high-solids epoxy primer and a high-solids polyurethane topcoat. Like the solvent-borne coatings used in the past, both products offer excellent resistance to moisture, alkalis and acids. The chemical compositions also ensure excellent durability to withstand abrasion and impact common in a manufacturing operation. Along with these features, each coating possesses special characteristics that made it ideal for United's finishing system. The two-component epoxy primer is EPA compliant, with a low VOC level (2.8 lb/gal) and high-solids composition (60.1 pct by weight). It also has a track record for excellent adhesion to cast iron and steel, and can be used as a primer or sealer on metal substrates. Polane® HS Plus topcoat provides similar benefits. It is a two-part high-solids polyurethane, with a low 2.8 lb/gal VOC level. It is also free of lead and chromate hazards. In addition to being hard and chemically resistant, the coating produces a high-gloss finish (90+). And most importantly for United, it retains its color and gloss even when exposed to inks and solvents used in corrugated box manufacturing. Infrared Technology. While convection and electric infrared ovens were considered, a gas-fired catalytic Thermoreactor was believed to be the right fit for United's finishing process. The reason for this lies with the nature of gas-fired catalytic infrared technology. Infrared is a part of the electromagnetic spectrum of energy. It is an invisible radiant wavelength that lies just beyond visible light to what is called the red side of the radiant spectrum. Every organic coating has a spectrum of infrared absorption, and through this absorption the coating temperature is increased. Curing with infrared waves occurs from the substrate out, and is known as molecular excitation. Nonvisible rays are emitted as they first pass through the organic coating to the substrate, and because the substrate does not absorb the infrared emissions, they are reflected back through the paint. In addition to curing coatings in a fraction of the time, another major benefit of infrared ovens is the prevention of skinning on the coating's outer surface, which can lead to pinholing. Solvent is instead forced from the substrate level to the surface of the coating where it evaporates. When the outer surface has finally cured, all internal solvent has escaped and none is left to cause pinholes. All pinholes, even microscopic, render a finish dull and rough. Gas-Fired Thermoreactor. The benefits achieved through infrared technology were a perfect match with United's finishing requirements and goal of lower VOC emissions. By installing this type of oven, curing could be dramatically accelerated, and a high-gloss finish could be created without pinholes, other defects or significant VOC emissions. Mr. Childs elected to go with a gas-fired catalytic Thermoreactor from Sunkiss. While both electric and gas-fired infrared ovens are effective, the gas-fired system was more appropriate for United's operations. Gasfired catalytic ovens emit an electronic spectrum between three and 10 microns, which is precisely the range absorbed by most organic coatings. Electric infrared wavelengths are shorter, between one and three microns, and hence are less effective at curing complex parts. Generally, this wavelength will only cure what is visible to the infrared source. For it to be most effective, the infrared unit must be within two ft of the part. United processes a variety of parts of different sizes and shapes, and cures these parts more efficiently with a gas-fired catalytic system. The booth is 18 ft wide, 24 ft long, and 14 ft high. It is equipped with 24 Thermoreactors, and in addition to infrared curing, provides convection heat. This heat assists the infrared in raising the temperature of the product coating to promote curing. In addition to enhanced curing, the booth offers United a safe finishing system. The ovens do not incorporate an open flame, electrical ignition or spark plugs. Instead, an electrical cal rod is used to provide heat to raise the catalytic pad temperature to a prescribed safe temperature for sustaining catalytic oxidation of the air/gas fuel. Solvents are literally thrown on the face of an operating catalytic pad with no resulting ignition, flash or flame. The system is designed to safely oxidize the solvents removed during curing, further reducing VOC emissions. United's new booth is also energy efficient. It uses a 6:1 mixture of fresh air to gas fuel to provide an oxygen-rich atmosphere for better fuel oxidation. This furnishes the necessary power for effective infrared curing. For the types of parts processed by the company, this range is between eight and 10 ft. Testing and Implementation. With the booth and coating system in place, Mr. Childs had to leap one last hurdle. He needed to train his painters. Coating sales representative Frank Burnette and technical service representative Ray Bubb of Sherwin-Williams, who were knowledgeable in gas-fired systems, offered their services. They conducted training sessions on prepping, mixing and applying the coatings, then explained the intricacies of the infrared booth. The brain that regulates the gas-fired booth is a computer control module. Once the module is programmed, a painter simply pushes one button to start the operating sequence. Process stages include a short purge, pre-heat, curing phase and final off purge. Within a month the painters completed their training and the system was phased-in. Through a series of trial runs, the painters learned how to position parts in the booth for maximum effectiveness. They also found that lower ambient temperatures were necessary for certain heat-sensitive components. The cure time for the various product components was reduced from eight hrs to an average of 30 min. Stellar Results. To say Marc Childs is satisfied with his new finishing system would be an understatement. He concluded, "The difference is like night and day. Our painters are no longer rushing to keep up with production, they are the plant's new pace-setters. Finish quality is outstanding, and we are far below VOC compliance levels. We have determined that energy consumption for the booth during curing is less than $4.25 per hr. With this low operating cost, together with the improved productivity, it is likely that United will be able to recoup its initial investment within the first year. We are better positioned than ever to respond to the customer's needs and take the lead in the global corrugated machine market."

By William W. Wellborn Vice President, Technology Washington Mills Co. North Grafton, Massachusetts A typical mass-finishing operation has many elements. And each one must be evaluated to determine what is best for your application as well as your wallet. Mass finishing can be used to clean, burnish or color parts. Each application requires different media and compounds. Also, part shape, size and fragility must be considered. Cleaning Oil and grease are removed from a part using a saponifying compound in combination with a non-abrasive media. Fast-cutting media and a detergent compound will cut through a layer of paint. A cutting or non-abrasive media in a chemically active compound removes heat treat, scale and rust from steel or oxides from copper and brass. Cutting is best performed using a fast-cutting media to remove coated abrasive belting lines, mold irregularities, machining marks or discoloration from heat treating. Cutting produces a smooth matte finish that is free of surface abnormalities. The surface also displays low reflectivity. Mass finishing regulates the degree of surface profile on a part. It is measured in terms of the average micro-inch distance from the surface's peaks to its valleys. The degree of surface texture is expressed as the root mean square (RMS) of these surface variations. A higher micro-finish translates into a rougher surface and, conversely, a lower number equates to a smoother surface. Burnishing a part's surface involves smoothing the surface peaks into the valleys, producing a highly reflective finish. The operation uses non-abrasive sintered bauxite or metal media and a viscous lubricating compound. Media with abrasive content can be used if the compound is especially viscous. Certain general concepts about burnishing include: 1) Dense media is preferred; 2) Smaller size media burnishes more effectively; 3) Media previously broken in and free of sharp edges or corners is required; 4) Burnishing cannot be achieved if a part's surface is ultra-smooth and devoid of surface peaks and valleys. Coloring is another phase of finishing that shows the degree of light reflectivity or light distortion of a part's surface. The operation exposes the ultimate color potential, polish or brightness of a part's surface. Deburring removes undesirable protrusions and sharp edges generated from previous manufacturing operations. There are three types of deburring operations. 1. Light deburring removes small brittle burrs produced by preliminary grinding operations or flash resulting from powdered metal moldings. Using a long-wearing media, these appendages are broken free from the part and the exposed edges are smoothed. 2. Heavy burr removal uses a fast-cutting media to remove large, thick burrs caused by sawing, milling, drilling or turning operations. 3. Radiusing rounds sharp edges or corners using cutting media ranging in composition from average to high. Part analysis In addition to addressing the work objective, proper media selection requires analysis of a part's hardness, ductility and configuration. Hardness impacts heavily on the type of abrasive used. Aluminum oxide abrasive has sufficient hardness to cut metals, alloy metals and plastics. Silicon carbide is the choice for processing carbides and ceramics. Hard materials are more brittle, so long-wearing, light abrasive media is best for removing heavy burrs. In radiusing hard materials, a small radius is produced quickly. Heavy radiuses are harder to generate. When ultra-smooth surface finishes are required on hard material, roughing must be performed initially in the soft state to ensure a minimum of cutting in the hardened state. Hardened work pieces are much less likely to be damaged by impingement or contact with other parts or media, therefore, larger media is used. Ductility Ductile parts are more prone to burring during preliminary machining operations. Such burrs are difficult to remove and fast cutting media is needed to remove them. Also, such parts are subject to more damage during the mass-finishing process from part-on-part impingement. Part Configuration A part's shape can impede or restrict normal media contact during a mass-finishing operation. One must consider recessed areas and odd-shaped parts when selecting media. Major Media Selection Considerations Media needs to be shaped so that there is as much surface contact as possible between media and parts. This is critical where parts have hard-to-reach areas. For a square part, the most productive media shape is a flat configuration. Cone-shaped, cylindrical or triangular media penetrates recesses in parts and does not lodge in them. Cone-shaped media is the most versatile for work applications because it features a flat base, flaring body and narrow or pointed nose. Most media manufacturers provide this shape in four basic sizes: 3/8 by 1/2 inch; 1/2 by 5/8 inch; 3/4 by 7/8 inch; and 1-1/8 by 1/4 inch. Size Selection Media size impacts the degree of cut or finish. Large media removes more metal because of the increased force it imposes. However, damage may result from impingement and denting. Careful control helps avoid this. Conversely, smaller media produces smoother finishes, resulting from the reduced cutting action. Media composition is the most difficult finishing decision because of the variables involved. The choice of abrasive type and grade is based on the work objectives, such as burnishing, light deburring, general purpose, fast cutting. Popular media selections are as follows: 1. Aluminum oxide abrasive media. The ideal aluminum oxide mass-finishing abrasive is dense and tough. Sintered bauxite has these attributes. Harder than steel, this ceramic media is used to color hardened steel, other ferrous metals, exotic metals, brass and aluminum. A pre-formed version enhances luster on stainless steel and exotic non-ferrous materials. Shape and closely controlled sizing also eliminate lodging in recessed areas. Fused aluminum oxide abrasive is a dense, solid structure with fine crystal size and carefully controlled chemistry. Pre-formed aluminum oxide media is a random-shaped, free and fast-cutting media provided in graded sizes for applications from burr removal to final surface finishing. 2. Silicon carbide. Unlike aluminum oxide, silicon carbide does not impregnate soft ductile metals. Therefore, this media is best for parts that will be welded or braised, for bearing surfaces and parts that will be machined after deburring. It is more friable than aluminum oxide and fractures more readily in contact with work pieces under heavy loads. Diamond, cubic boron nitride and boron carbide are the only media abrasives harder and sharper than silicon carbide. Silicone carbide is especially effective with non-ferrous metals such as brass, copper and aluminum. It is preferred for finishing hard, brittle parts like cemented carbides, ceramics, granite, marble, glass, cast iron and low-tensile-strength, ductile non-ferrous materials. 3. Ceramic media. Ceramic compositions are virtually all abrasive, hard and are more abrasive than equivalent resin-bonded media. The combination of an ultra-tough surface area and rigidity exposes a constant abrading surface and an aggressive cutting action. Available in a number of compositions, ceramic media can be used in a variety of delicate or aggressive applications, including burnishing, radiusing, polishing, rapid cut down, deflashing and deburring. 4. Resin-bonded media produces softer surface finishing action and provides a uniform finish. The media is best for parts requiring more restricted edge and corner radiusing. Resin-bonded media is manufactured in lower densities than ceramic media. The media smooths parts but does not impart a high luster. Post-finishing Operations Post-finishing processes often determine the type of media used. If the part will be plated, a smooth surface is mandatory. If aluminum oxide abrasive is used, a fine grit is needed to avoid subsequent dull plating. For parts destined for welding, brazing or soldering, silicon carbide is required. Parts undergoing painting are processed with fast-cutting media to develop the rough, matte finish required for adhesion. The role of compounds in mass finishing is to keep parts and media clean. The chemical compounds remove solids and grease and lubricate the media. They also reduce loading and glazing. Some compounds are used in two-stage processes. Stage one fosters the rate of cut initially and the second stage enhances luster. An abrasive compound is applied in the first operation for maximum metal or burr removal. Following a careful cleaning operation, a burnishing compound is used that lubricates the media and parts and promotes coloring. Compounds also reduce corrosion, effectively protecting parts during the entire manufacturing operation. Chemically active compounds remove rust and scale from parts. In burnishing operations, non-abrasive media immersed in a viscous compound works well. Abrasive media is acceptable in company with more viscous compounds. Water is used less with metal parts because of rusting. Caustic compounds are used with steel parts without concern for rust. Caustics, however, will attack aluminum. Steel and iron can be run with compounds above pH 7. Brass copper and stainless clean well in slightly acidic compounds. Since aluminum parts require a neutral compound, detergents are used because they do not attack metal. With the availability of many machine designs, along with improved media, descaling can be accomplished by mechanical action alone, free from compounds. Parts processing equipment. The extensive availability of mass-finishing equipment provides for a broad selection. Choices of mass-finishing equipment run the gamut from basic rotating and vibratory units to automated designs producing high-energy output. Machines can be divided into five major categories: 1) Barrel tumblers; 2) Vibratory finishers; 3) Centrifugal finishers; 4) Centrifugal disc finishers; and 5) Spindle machines. The size and operating intensity are major considerations when selecting media. Tumbling barrels use media with more abrasive content and less strength. High-intensity machines, such as centrifugal types use media with less abrasive but require material with high-impact strength. Vibratory finishers range in the center in intensity between tumbling and centrifugal. Radial bowls are regarded as the most gentle vibratory type. Circular vibratory bowls are popular where frequent media changes are not required.

The slowness of Monroe's wastewater treatment system for zinc and chromium was also keeping the plating firm from increasing its operations. Monroe knew that water from the Hemlock Lake, a watershed that feeds city lines, is eventually discharged into Lake Ontario and represents a valuable, potentially recyclable resource. Now, thanks to a low-cost loan from New York State and the vision of company management, Rochester's largest contract zinc plater has unveiled a $300,000 wastewater treatment system. The system purifies city water prior to operations. It also discharges water containing 0.5 or fewer ppm of zinc and chromium. This is three times better than the limit set by Monroe County Pure Waters. Incoming city water is first fed through an ion-exchange system that removes metals and other impurities, including iron and chlorine. "Cleaning" water prior to plating has helped Monroe achieve greater productivity, increased part quality, less maintenance, and waste reduction. Moreover, the goal of recycling 60 to 70 pct of all water used at the plant is well within reach. Following plating, a membrane-type filtration system is used. In this system, water containing heavy metals is sent under high pressure through a series of membrane tubes. Solids are separated and sent through a filter press. The sludge from the filter press is treated and placed in a secured landfill. After trace amounts of zinc, chromates, and other metals are removed from the water, the pH is adjusted and the water is safely discharged. With the new wastewater treatment system from Wheelabrator Clean Water Inc., Memtek Division, operators now have fewer variables to control or eliminate, including temperature variations (the system is temperature controlled) and various imperfections caused by chlorine and iron. Also, there is a reduced need for general housekeeping, which had involved weekly hand scrubbing of each enormous tank. Because water purification before plating results in cleaner tanks, eliminating that one cleaning operation has saved Monroe hundreds of hours of labor. Other benefits of the new wastewater treatment system include savings on water and chemical purchases, less equipment downtime, better control over a repeatable process and less waste. The bottom line? Monroe Plating is poised to accept a significant amount of new business. Monroe Plating had to budget for water since it was a spiraling cost. The company spent approximately $5,000 a month on water, including the cost of purchasing and discharging chemicals to treat the water ($4,000) and the treatment and disposal of heavy-metal sludge ($1,000). Now, with the new wastewater treatment system in place, Monroe expects to pay back its $300,000 investment in less than six years, given its present level of activity, or in half that time if the company adds another shift. Monroe's water treatment system reflects the company's concern for the environment, and, with its wastewater treatment capacity, also positions the company for significant growth. Water Treatment Helps Win Contracts for Windows and Brakes Assigning work to outside vendors for specific processes or services is becoming more commonplace. For the zinc rack and barrel metal plating industry, the trend toward outsourcing is often in response to increasingly stringent controls and expensive environmental compliance procedures. Outsourcing zinc plating has helped two established upstate New York manufacturers improve quality control, add to the bottom-line and eliminate environmental concerns over wastewater treatment in manufacturing operations. New York Air Brake Corp. New York Air Brake Corp., Watertown, New York, has a longevity enviable in its business. Founded in the mid 19th century to produce braking systems for trains, the company is still doing that today. New York Air Brake is one of the two primary providers of railroad air brake systems in North America and export markets. Through the efforts of New York Air Brake's 450 employees, the company achieved ISO 9001 status in April 1994, for all areas of the company's operations and engineering. New York Air Brake had used a cyanide-based plating process; however, growing environmental concerns and customer specifications calling for zinc plating led the company to pursue outsourcing. "Our products operate under extreme conditions where durability and corrosion resistance are essential, and zinc plating plays an important role in achieving these goals," noted Mark Wuerschmidt, manager of facility and environmental engineering. The qualities that encouraged New York Air Brake to bring their work to Monroe Plating, according to Mr. Wuerschmidt, became evident during a plant tour. He says the working environment, employees' attention to detail, emphasis on quality and competitive pricing made Monroe Plating the company of choice. A real concern with outsourcing is turnaround time. Mr. Wuerschmidt said the five-working-day turnaround time agreed to with Monroe has been factored into New York Air Brake's production planning. Monroe Plating has been able to meet the brake manufacturer's quality criteria for color, surface finish, adhesion, and plating thickness. Joanna Window Decor If you were born before 1950, you probably remember a time when nearly every window in every home was covered by a window shade. Window treatments have changed since then, but for the past 78 years, high-quality wood and metal window shades have been manufactured by Joanna Window Decor in Ogdensburg, New York. At one point the company, now owned by Crown Home Furnishings Company in Charlotte, North Carolina, was the largest roller manufacturer in the country. Today, in spite of trends and recessions, the private business employs 70 people and remains strong. Mike Link, general manager, explained, "Window rollers started in Europe in medieval times, when they painted scenes on fabric and used it to cover window openings for light control and privacy." According to Mr. Link, the market has a more conservative consumer base. The quality of the window shade products has been grouped into a three-tier system: 1) Stock shade quality, which is sold in department stores and local shade shops; 2) Custom shade quality, which is made to customer specifications at a slightly higher cost; and 3) Contact shade quality, for cost-effective use in subsidized housing, hospitals, and schools. "We build nearly every part we use by hand, including metal stamping. We even wind our own springs," Mr. Link explained. Until recently, that attention to detail included zinc plating for parts and components. Now Monroe does the plating. Mr. Link says increasingly stringent environmental controls over zinc plating encouraged Joanna to outsource plating instead of spending approximately $100,000 to install a waste treatment system and train people to run it so it could continue to do zinc plating in house. "The people at Monroe Plating took a big burden off our shoulders," said Mr. Link. "After we analyzed the cost of doing plating, we realized that outsourcing was more effective and less costly in the end." Trends in Zinc Plating Demands More QC As zinc plating specialists, Monroe Plating sees growth markets in industries where corrosion is a serious concern. Zinc plating protects from corrosion, as does the chromate conversion coating that often follows plating. A trend toward a three-year, under-the-hood warranty for engine corrosion is likely to increase the demand for plating in the automotive industry. Moreover, turnings and screw machine parts represent a growth market for barrel plating, which is used to plate small parts. "We are also looking for plating work being outsourced by major OEMs," said Ken McAlpin, company president. "Many manufacturers are getting out of zinc plating because of environmental restrictions. We've been able to take on these operations while providing reduced costs, better quality, and improved service. We also feel like a good neighbor for meeting or exceeding the environmental restraints." Monroe's motivation is reflected in part by a two-week period of quality problems. "We dumped cleaners, we changed rinse tanks, and we checked everything. It was a mess before we discovered what was wrong," said Ken. "The incoming city water was too high in iron contaminants and none of our parts could pass our own stringent quality control test. "We knew that in order to grow the company, we had to improve our wastewater treatment system," Ken said. "And with the new system in place, we can now grow as large and as fast as the upstate economy will allow." SIDEBAR: Thirty Years of Quality Zinc Plating Back in 1967, Lyndon Johnson was President, St. Louis won the World Series, and two Rochester natives and entrepreneurial tool and die makers, Frank McAlpin and Ralph Derleth, founded Monroe Plating at 255 Hollenbeck Street in Rochester. Both men wanted to be able to accommodate the plating work they were generating through their plant, McAlpin-Derleth, formed three years previously to do high-precision stampings (usually plated) for the business machine market. Mr. McAlpin became sole owner of the company in 1980. Today, his three sons, Ken, Dan and Mike, run the company, with some experienced guidance from their dad, who retains the title of CEO. Frank McAlpin is especially proud of the company's second- generation management. "We work hard to keep the roles clear," said oldest brother and company president Ken McAlpin. Dan is vice president of engineering and operations, while Mike is materials manager. From a small customer base, the company has grown significantly in other markets by acquiring skills, upgrading statistical controls on machinery, and adding space. Monroe's mission, according to Ken, is to work as closely as possible with customers to produce superior plated products. "We knew that if we wanted quality zinc plating, we would have to do it ourselves," Ken noted. "And that search for quality has paid off, with additional business from industries where quality control is a governing factor in how the business is run." As for future generations in this family-owned business, this could take a while. There are several grandchildren of founder Frank McAlpin, but the youngest McAlpins are all still in grade school. But when they are ready, Monroe Plating will still be state of the art.

By James P. Wikenczy Manager of Mfg. Engineering TABC, Inc. Long Beach, California Toyota Auto Body of California (TABC), Inc., Long Beach, California, manufactures truck beds that are supplied to other Toyota plants for assembly. The facility includes a stamping plant, body shop for assembly and a paint shop. It currently produces 170,000 truck beds per year using two nine-hr shifts. Truck bodies first pass through a nine-stage zinc phosphate pretreatment system. This is followed by an electrocoat primer and cure at 375F. After curing, truck beds receive a primer-surfacer and an enamel topcoat, which are both cured in convection ovens. Each of the ovens is exhausted to thermal oxidizer units when the paint solvents are oxidized. Controlling VOCs emitted during curing the electrocoat primer is always challenging. When a freshly painted truck bed leaves the electrocoating tank and enters the curing oven, a combination of unreacted resins, coalescing solvents and high-molecular-weight organics are exposed to the oven's high temperature. This results in a significant amount of smoking as the parts enter the oven through an air seal. Controlling air balance in order to retain this smoke within the oven is crucial, since escaping fumes can make a shop uncomfortable for employees. In late 1992, TABC noticed that its four-year-old thermal oxidizer was showing signs of structural failure. An inspection determined that even with temporary repairs, the unit would probably only last six to 12 months. Rather than look at replacing the oxidizer with a similar unit, the company decided to investigate all the options available. The goal was to reduce the cost of operating the thermal oxidizer, which was exhausting approximately 5,000 cfm at 900F. Also, production personnel wanted to increase the exhaust flow rate by venting a canopy between the electrocoating tank and the oven to the oxidizer. This would eliminate fume spill-out from the entry end of the oven. Reviewing the Options. The challenge was to find a technology that increased the vent rate approximately 11,000 cfm without costing more to operate than the smaller existing thermal oxidizer. Other issues, such as equipment size and weight, lead time and proven ability to treat the highly resinous exhaust from the oven, were crucial in the evaluation. Table I summarizes a number of possible options that were considered. Following a thorough review, two options were selected for further analysis. The company wanted to investigate recuperative and regenerative thermal oxidation. TABLE I -- Comparison of Options OPTION CAPITAL COST OPERATING COST COMMENTS Electrostatic Precipitator High Low High maintenance experienced at other Toyota plant, not effective at controlling VOCs with high efficiency Scrubber Low Very High Low efficiency at VOC control Carbon Adsorption High High Not suitable for high temperature oven exhaust Catalytic Oxidation Medium Medium Poisoning of catalyst and high maintenance experienced in other Toyota plants. Thermal (Recuperative) Oxidation Low High Proven in electrocoat fumeoxidation. Very high operating cost and high NOx emissions. Thermal (Regenerative) Oxidation High Low Proven in electrocoat fume oxidation, very low operating cost, low NOx emissions. While the existing recuperative oxidizer was effectively destroying the electrocoating oven fumes, the relatively high operating cost was a concern. This was particularly true since TABC wished to increase its exhaust rate. Regenerative thermal oxidation offered low operating costs, primarily due to the high (95 pct) thermal energy recovery possible. However, the large size and weight of the regenerative unit meant a new location was needed. Table II compares the two forms of thermal oxidation with a nominal flow rate of 11,000 scfm. TABLE II -- Comparison of Regenerative and Recuperative Thermal Oxidation RECUPERATIVE REGENERATIVE Size 12 ft diameter x 22 ft 15 ft x 48 ft Weight 22,000 lb 68,000 lb Thermal Efficiency 65 pct 95 pct VOC Destruction Efficiency 98 pct 98 pct Capital Cost (Installed) $600,000 $800,000 Operating Cost (annual) $190,000 $68,000 Delivery Time 16-18 weeks 18-20 weeks Considering this analysis, TABC selected a Compact Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (CTO) unit from Durr Industries, Inc., Plymouth, Michigan. The skid-mounted CTO unit is shop built to minimize field erection time. Because of its weight, the unit was located at grade level beside the paint shop. Figure 1 shows an isometric view of the three ceramic-filled chambers in the unit. VOC-laden air enters the bottom of one of the chambers and is preheated as it flows upward through the hot ceramic bed. The burner at the top of the chamber adds additional heat to oxidize organic materials into carbon dioxide and water vapor. The clean hot gases exit through one of the adjacent chambers and transfer heat to that ceramic bed before release to atmosphere. Figure 1: Regenerative thermal oxidation system schematic After a certain time, the cycle is reversed so that inlet and outlet chambers switch to outlet and inlet cycles. At any given time, one of the three towers is purged. In this process, clean air is vented through a tower, pushing any unburned hydrocarbons through the burner prior to that tower's switching to an outlet cycle. This ensures that no unburned solvents are vented to the atmosphere. This process is responsible for the high thermal efficiency of the regenerative oxidizer. The unit is vented through an exhaust fan located downstream. An Allen-Bradley 1336VT 125-hp drive is used to maintain flow and air balance in the electrocoat oven, guaranteeing ventilation of the solvent and smoke from the oven through a signal from a pressure transducer in the interconnecting duct. When tested, the CTO unit destroyed more than 95 pct of the incoming organics at an operating temperature of 1,370F. The increased air flow from the oven and entry canopy area also improved the working environment for TABC employees. Operating costs of the unit are lower than for the smaller recuperative unit it replaced.

Manufacturers of large-sized equipment often face challenges when preparing, painting and curing products. The size and weight of the parts they manufacture make it difficult to achieve smooth, efficient work flow in a reasonable amount of floor space. This was on the minds of executives at Robinson Helicopter Company, Torrance, California, as they planned a move into a 260,000-sq-ft manufacturing facility that would triple the space of the previous site. Robinson Helicopter is a leading manufacturer of light helicopters for worldwide markets. As the company grew, its existing quarters became too small. Insufficient space and inconvenient location of the paint prep, priming, painting and drying areas had become a real stumbling block to the efficiency and increased production capability it sought for growth. Before the move, company President Frank Robinson met with Ed Broman, vice president of procurement, and Wayne Walden, vice president of manufacturing, to examine the finishing operation. Mr. Robinson envisioned a new and efficient physical layout to streamline work flow. His goal was to move the helicopter from preparation through final trim painting in as compact an area as possible, reducing the time and labor required for painting and curing. The Robinson Helicopter team formulated several goals, including faster throughput, reduced labor, and better overall finish quality. Although the company's paint spray process had always been in compliance with California's South Coast Air Quality Management District's (SCAQMD) regulations, it hoped to improve for the future. Defining the problems. Upon further study and analysis, the team decided to completely redesign the finishing process with all new equipment. Citing specific situations that needed streamlining, Mr. Broman noted, "Some inefficiencies were obvious and related to space constraints. For example, each aircraft coming off the manufacturing line had to be wheeled outside for cleaning, sanding and masking. Then it was moved to one building for priming and to another building for painting. There, the craft remained in the paint booth for three hours to dry between coats. Convection heating is used for curing. This excessive maneuvering from location to location slowed production, and the paint spray booth was inoperable while the paint dried." The team targeted other problems as well. For drying and curing, heated-air supply units were used as heaters to dry the helicopters after painting. Incoming outside air was heated to 120F, introduced into the booth, then exhausted into atmosphere. Improving this time-consuming, expensive and energy-wasting process became a priority. Finding solutions. Armed with a preliminary work flow plan, Robinson Helicopter called on Binks Manu-facturing Company, Franklin Park, Illinois. Bob Hauck, industrial market manager at Binks' Los Angeles office, coordinated the project. The company designed two spray paint systems that would enable Robinson Helicopter to maximize product flow, improve finish quality, meet all SCAQMD requirements and reduce operational costs. The design of the helicopter finishing facility was a total team effort, customizing various technologies to this specific application. Paint spray booths. Two spray booth systems, one for priming and one for topcoating, are at the heart of the paint spray systems. The booths are drive-through enclosures, and each is equipped with an adjoining IR tunnel that also incorporates convection heat. Robinson Helicopter selected cross-draft booths, similar to the units used previously. Each booth has a dedicated air make-up system that supplies filtered, heated air to a supply chamber built into the booth. The new spray booths are quieter, because of mufflers installed in the exhaust stack. In addition, larger door sizes and increased interior lighting for better visibility were added. Between the two large main booths are two prep booths, where all cleaning, sanding and masking are done. This setup allows the helicopter to be sanded, cleaned and masked in the prep booth; primed, topcoated and trim-painted in the large spray booths; and pushed directly into the infrared section of the oven for curing. It's an efficient configuration that has dramatically improved work flow by eliminating the time and labor needed to transport the craft from one process to the next. Spray guns. The HVLP spray guns are conventional air spray guns with special modifications and nozzles that allow the gun to operate within SCAQMD VOC emissions regulations. The air passage has a sonic venturi that limits air flow by creating a shock wave in the venturi throat. The air and fluid nozzles allow the gun to atomize the fluid at low air pressures and velocities. The sonic venturi and gun nozzles interact to limit the air pressure to a maximum of 10 psi at the nozzle. Normal operating pressure at the air nozzle is three to five psi, where Robinson has found it obtains the best transfer efficiency. The gun uses ambient compressed air from the shop air supply. A five-hp compressor is used to supply the atomizing air. However, compressed air use is low, ranging from 11 to 20 scfm, depending on the operating pressure. The painter controls the atomizing air pressure, fluid flow and spray pattern. Frank Robinson states that he is satisfied that the new design implements his original vision. He comments: "It is an impressive sight to see the booths and ovens end to end in a space that is just 90 ft long and 50 ft wide. Infrared curing technology improves quality. Infrared curing and monitoring/control technologies were installed in the ovens to meet special requirements. For example, infrared remote surface-temperature-monitoring probes are arranged in the IR oven section of each booth, profiling the entire craft and constantly monitoring surface temperature, to ensure that temperature never exceeds 160F. The craft's plastic windshield would warp at higher temperatures. A specially designed spray-booth control panel incorporates a silhouette of the ship's profile, illuminated by LED indicator lights that display the actual temperature of the helicopter surface at each probe. If the set point is exceeded at any position, a built-in alarm system warns the operator, and the system shuts down automatically. Operators attest that this custom-tailored system is not only accurate and reliable, but very easy to use. The IR ovens also combine hot air convection heat with IR radiant heat to provide a flexible and efficient system that gives operators better control of the curing process across a wide range of conditions. Mr. Robinson recommended this combination of heating technologies because of the helicopter's complex configuration. The hot air convection was accomplished using duct heaters and blowers to circulate heated air (120 to 160F) through the oven enclosure, enveloping the aircraft. The heat setting is controlled from a remote thermostat in the control panel. Operators report that, on average, the infrared heat alone is sufficient for fast, high-quality cures. But they have the option of adding convection heat for speedy curing in high humidity, eliminating production delays. Mr. Broman noted time savings and increased quality are the two major benefits Robinson Helicopter has realized as a direct result of the new drying ovens. He stated, "Since the installation, the paint surface quality of our helicopters has been uniformly excellent, thanks to the combined IR/convection ovens. Equally important is that the time required for curing is now a fraction of what it was, dropping from three hours to about 45 min." New small parts line saves time and money. To complete the new finishing operation, Robinson Helicopter also added a small parts line for prime coating and curing of miscellaneous parts. This line includes a waterwash booth, IR oven, and overhead conveyor system that transports parts into the booth where they are sprayed by operators using electrostatic hand guns. Initially, when the supplier recommended a waterwash booth, Robinson Helicopter engineers were hesitant about accepting it, since they had previously used only dry filter booths. However, the "E" style booth included a Centri-Clean™ system, which uses centrifugal force to automatically dewater, compact and discharge paint solids from the spray booth. Once Robinson Helicopter saw the benefits, it agreed to both the waterwash concept and the additional installation expense in order to eliminate the waste disposal expense of dry filters. Although operators admit that it took time to adjust to the waterwash booth, the results of the choice have been overwhelmingly positive. The new unit eliminates the need to change filters, reducing both maintenance time and labor. Recycling the booth water supply conserves energy. Waste disposal costs have dropped considerably, due to the minimized waste from the Centri-Clean. Overall environmental improvements. With the new system design, Robinson Helicopter has realized its goal of developing a cleaner, more environmentally friendly finishing process. A special filter, approved for eliminating hexavalent chromium emissions, was installed in the exhaust of each of the new spray booths. The filter, known as a "PE Cell," is manufactured by Air Technologies, Inc. The large main spray booths use a two-stage filter inside the booth, with the final "PE Cell" filter located higher upstream in the exhaust chamber. These filters successfully eliminate all chromate emissions, as specified by SCAQMD regulations. For the same reason, the waterwash booth is also equipped with this type of final filter, located in the exhaust of the wash section, enabling the booths to meet some of the toughest air regulations in the country. Evaluating the results. Robinson Helicopter is satisfied that the new finishing system meets all of the stated goals. The company now produces a total of 195 new aircraft each year. Current throughput of the paint production process is six crafts per week, including three four-seat R44s and three two-seat R22s and two overhauls of original equipment. Frank Robinson concluded: "We've already realized our original objectives, in terms of improved quality, better environmental control and reduced operational process time. However, the most significant advantage of installing the new system is the expansion of our production capabilities. We're better positioned than ever before to meet the light helicopter demands of a global marketplace, now and far into the future."

Paul Crea H.B. Fuller Company Oakdale, Minnesota Powder coating has come a long way since the 1970's. Recent advancements ensure that powder use will continue to grow through the next century. Much of this growth can be attributed to powder's excellent durability and finish, lower cost and high efficiency. Additionally, powder coating is more environmentally friendly than conventional solvent-borne systems. During the manufacturing and application processes, little or no VOCs are emitted into the atmosphere, and waste is minimized by recycling overspray. Powder Use. The global use of thermoset powder coatings has been rapidly growing about 10 pct annually. Consequently, the performance expectations that manufacturers place on powder coatings have become more demanding. Nowhere is this more true than in the automotive market. While automobile assembly plants are in the infancy stage of powder application, their suppliers have been using powders to coat various automobile parts for years. There are virtually hundreds of such suppliers in the United States. The automobile parts to which powder coatings are applied include: roof racks, door handles, oil and fuel filters, brake pads, engines, exterior and interior trim. These suppliers work with various powder manufacturers to ensure that the coatings meet stringent automobile specifications. There are ten major powder manufacturers that account for about 70 pct of the sales to this market. Combined, these manufacturers sold more than $100 million of powder to the automobile parts industry in 1994. Figure 1 shows the historical and forecasted powder consumption for the automotive market through 1999. Durability Requirements. Both the polymer and the pigments used in powder coatings can be attacked by the elements associated with exterior weathering (ultraviolet light, moisture, and heat). Over time, this causes deterioration that may result in film delamination, fading and a loss of gloss. For these reasons, powder coatings are tested to meet automotive specifications prior to their use by suppliers to the automotive OEM's. Some of the most common tests are Weatherometer, QUV and humidity. In addition to these accelerated tests, most automotive specifications also require that the products be tested for corrosion resistance and resistance to various solvents and chemicals. For a product to be approved, it must meet all of the criteria set forth by the automobile manufacturers. Since the average life of an automobile is about six to eight years, the ideal situation would be for there to be at least this amount of weathering exposure data. Consequently, automotive OEMs are now increasing their durability requirements to meet increasingly harsher environments. Depending on applications, current OEM specifications usually require a minimum of one year South Florida exposure while others require two years of data. In the future, this requirement will be raised to five years for most exterior applications. General Chemistry Background. With increasing government regulation of VOC emissions and the new rules governing HAPs, Hazardous Air Pollutants, more and more suppliers are turning to powder coating for compliance. This has resulted in several trends regarding preferred chemistries for specific end-uses. Polyester/TGIC. The most familiar of these are the polyester/TGIC coatings originally used as clear coats, and later as metallic base coats on wheels. These coatings show excellent durability with good impact resistance, and, when covered with a clearcoat, durability approaches five years. With improvements in resin technology and increasing smoothness, the polyester/TGIC systems are approaching the look of acrylics. Table I gives some of the typical properties and ranges for Polyester/TGIC systems. In addition to excellent weatherability, other advantages of polyester/TGIC systems include excellent gloss retention, over-bake color stability, good mechanical properties at high-film build, good salt-spray resistance, and a wide range of colors, including metallic effects and textures. Some of the drawbacks are that it is difficult to formulate a low-gloss finish, and to get very smooth coatings at film builds lower than 1.5 mils. Additionally, polyester/TGIC systems offer lower solvent resistance than the polyester/urethane chemistries. Acrylics. Acrylic systems are an emerging technology because of the more stringent weathering requirements of OEM's. Currently, the most common acrylic application is as a clearcoat on wheels. Some common uses include exterior trim and blackout coatings. Acrylics offer the advantages of excellent weathering combined with lower temperature cure, good distinctness of image, excellent gloss retention, and good salt-spray resistance. They are among the smoothest of all powder coatings in use today. The drawbacks to the acrylic chemistry include low impact resistance, poor flexibility, and incompatibility with other chemistries. Table II gives some typical properties of acrylics. Polyester/Urethane. A powder chemistry that is not quite as smooth as acrylic but allows better flexibility and impact resistance is polyester/urethane. Powder coatings of this type offer good salt-spray resistance and gloss retention, up to 4H pencil hardness, and low-gloss matte finishes, as well as exceptional flexibility. Table III gives some typical properties. The main disadvantage for urethanes is thick film limitations. This is due to the volatilization of the blocking agent during cure. Hybrid. The hybrid system is a proven chemistry for primers. Offering certain advantages of epoxy systems combined with polyester systems, these powders will offer good intercoat adhesion and chip resistance. Hybrids also offer good mechanical properties combined with good salt-spray resistance. Some of the disadvantages of hybrids are marginal UV resistance and softer films than epoxies. Table IV shows typical properties of hybrids. Epoxy. The final powder chemistry used by the automotive market is the epoxy system. These are primarily used under the hood where UV exposure in minimal and gloss retention is not a concern. Some of the most common uses are for engine block castings, suspension components, and radiators. The advantages of epoxies include excellent chemical resistance, smoothness, excellent corrosion resistance and adhesion, and good abrasion resistance. The primary disadvantage is poor UV resistance, which leads to chalking and loss of gloss. As a result, epoxies are ideal for under the hood since there is very little UV exposure and corrosion resistance is key. Table V offers some typical properties of epoxy powder coatings. From the preceding information one can see that there is an emerging trend toward powder coating use in the automotive market. With the various chemistries available today, one can be found to meet almost every need of today's OEM automotive part producer. Powder coatings offer excellent physical properties and are more environmentally friendly than conventional solvent-based systems. With increasing regulations, powder will certainly become an even bigger player in the automotive market.

By Joseph T. Menke Chemical Engineer U.S. Army Rock Island, Illinois This is the first of a three-part series on the application of zincphosphate coatings to substrates other than steel. Part I will expose process control problems encountered during the production of zinc phosphate coatings on zinc-plated surfaces. On various parts, the zinc phosphate coating was to provide corrosion resistance, prepaint treatment or pretreatment to enhance adhesion. Part II will show the results of applying different types of zinc phosphate coatings on zinc-plated and galvanized surfaces. Part III will show the results of applying various types of zinc phosphate coatings on cadmium plated and aluminum surfaces. Having some knowledge of light (paint base) zinc phosphate coatings on steel, I was asked to participate in a project that involved the application of these coatings on zinc-plated parts. One zinc-plated part required a zinc phosphate coating as a supplemental finish for corrosion protection. Another zinc-plated part required a phosphate coating to promote adhesive bonding of a rubber. A third part required paint adhesion to a zinc-plated part. All the parts were failing for various reasons. The supplemental phosphate on zinc-plated parts exhibited white corrosion after only eight hrs of salt spray testing. The salt spray requirement on the hardware was 48 hrs exposure with no evidence of white corrosion. Parts with the rubber showed disbonding after simulation testing. The phosphated zinc surfaces failed adhesion tests that were performed after the epoxy paint had cured for one week. The approach to solving the problems was to characterize the phosphate coating in each application by determining coating weight, crystal structure and coverage. Coating weight on the zinc surfaces was determined using a sodium dichromate/ammonium hydroxide stripping solution on the phosphated zinc surfaces. Crystal structure and coverage were determined using a scanning electron microscope at 500x magnification. Photos at this magnification were used to previously characterize zinc phosphate coatings on steel. An investigation determined the ability of zinc-phosphate-coated zinc-plated parts to provide corrosion resistance (the formation of white corrosion product during salt spray testing). Werner Raush reported corrosion resistance to white corrosion of up to 48 hrs in the salt spray test1 . Mr. Raush also stated that phosphating improves resistance to "white rust" formation on zinc surfaces during storage or transport under normal conditions. Initial testing of a phosphate coating showed white corrosion product after eight hours of five pct salt spray (ASTMB117) exposure. Incorporation of a bright dip prior to phosphating produced a smaller size crystalline structure that provided 24 hrs of salt spray resistance prior to formation of white corrosion. A third process provided a very fine crystalline zinc phosphate coating on zinc-plated parts. An investigation into the chemicals showed no grain refinement step in the phosphating operation. Contact with the chemical manufacturer revealed that the alkaline cleaner contained titanium salts. Since the concentration of the titanium salts in the cleaner was less than one pct, and the titanium is not considered toxic or hazardous, titanium salts were not listed on the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). The phosphating applicator had no way of knowing what was contributing to the fine grain structure on the product. Accelerated salt spray testing showed no white corrosion after 48 hrs exposure on these parts. This investigation essentially shows that a fine crystalline zinc phosphate coating with complete coverage can reduce the susceptibility of zinc-plated surfaces to the formation of white (zinc) corrosion. An investigation determined zinc-phosphate coating processing parameters for adhesive bonding. The adhesive manufacturer recommended a calcium-modified zinc phosphate with a coating weight of 150300 mg per sq ft for optimum adhesive bonding on zinc surfaces. Examination of the calcium-modified zinc phosphate coating on zinc-plated parts revealed a large crystal structure of essentially zinc phosphate and coating weights in the 9001,000 mg per sq ft range. The phosphate coating applicator processed the parts for three min. Reducing the time to one and a half min did not reduce the coating weight appreciably. A titanium predip prior to phosphating reduced the coating weight to 600800 mg per sq ft and reduced the crystal size. Testing followed formation of the phosphate coating. Acid-zinc-plated specimens were zinc phosphate coated in a calcium-modified solution for 5, 10, 20, 40 and 180 seconds. Next, acid-zinc plated specimens were treated with a titanium salt rinse/dip and phosphated in the same calcium-modified solution. The specimens were removed after 5, 10, 20, 40, and 180 seconds. The titanium rinse resulted in a finer crystal structure and quicker coverage compared to the specimens not given the treatment. Coating weight at 180 seconds was essentially the same, which could be expected since the phosphating solution was the same. Two significant observations of the calcium-modified coating (no titanium predip) on zinc were that no nodular coating was formed, and the coating weights exceed the 150300 mg per sq ft, which is typical of calcium-modified zinc phosphate coating on steel. When the adhesive manufacturer was asked to provide a sample, the nodular coating was received and had a coating weight of 200 mg per sq ft. Further testing showed the substrate to be steel, not zinc. Thus, the adhesive manufacturer did not know that it was impossible to meet its own specifications. Specimens processed in an alkaline-zinc solution were given a titanium rinse and processed in a nickelfluoride (NiF) zinc phosphating solution. The final coating weight is approximately 40 pct lower than the calcium-modified coating. This shows that other phosphating solutions could be used to achieve the lower coating weight recommended by the adhesive manufacturer. It is suspected that the adhesive manufacturer's experience was with calcium-modified phosphate on steel and they assumed that the calcium-modified solution would provide a similar coating on zinc. A third investigation evaluated a phosphate coating on cyanide-zinc-plated parts for the purpose of applying an epoxy primer and urethane topcoat. Some time had elapsed (a few days to a week) prior to actually applying the phosphate coating. The zinc-plated parts were immersed directly into the phosphating solution as the parts were still perceived to be "clean" after zinc plating. A majority of the zinc surface had little or no phosphate coating. On another part, the only phosphate coating formed on a silicate inclusion (parts were sandblasted to remove rust prior to zinc plating) in the zinc plating. On still another area, where a fingerprint was obvious, a uniform fine-grain phosphate coating was observed with complete coverage. The fingerprint residue acted as a grain refiner. Some type of oxidation or passivation had occurred prior to phosphating, making the zinc surface relatively unresponsive to the phosphating solution. Since phosphate coatings form on cathode areas and the blast media would be a cathode with respect to zinc plating, the observation of a phosphate crystal could be expected on the particle of silica. Subsequently, an alkaline cleaner with a titanium grain refiner was used prior to phosphating. This coating provided an adequate paint base that successfully passed the paint adhesion test. There is still additional knowledge needed to be somewhat proficient at knowing what to expect when various types of pretreatments, activators and phosphating solutions are used to produce zinc phosphate coatings on zinc-plated surfaces. For those thinking about trying this or are doing it for the first time, this article should present some indication of the degree of complexity that is involved in applying quality coatings that enhance the functional requirements of coating systems. The federal specification for paint-based phosphate coatings, TTC490, states that phosphate coatings can be applied to substrates other than zinc-plated and steel parts2. Paint-based phosphate formulations can also be applied to galvanized steel, cadmium plating and aluminum. Phosphate solutions include nitrate, chlorate and iron accelerated types, nickel- fluorides, calcium-modified, and manganese-modified (trimetal or polycrystalline) formulations applied by spray or immersion processes. Subsequent articles will show the results of using various phosphating formulations and processes and showing the resulting phosphate crystal structures.     PF REFERENCES: 1.

By Graham Legge Abar Ipsen Industries Bensalem, Pennsylvania The aerospace industry recognizes the application of a highly adherent, continuous aluminum coating onto metallic substrates using ion vapor deposition (IVD) techniques as a replacement for electroplated cadmium. Vacuum deposition as a method of applying metallic films onto both metal and non-metal substrates is a mature and well-established industry. Its origins coincide with the emergence and growth of the electronics and aerospace industries. IVD of aluminum improves on this traditional technology. The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, McDonnell Aircraft Division, undertook the commercial development of IVD technology at its St. Louis, Missouri, facility. The coating system was developed during the 1960's in order to supply a functionally equivalent or better replacement for cadmium electroplating when its negative environmental impact was first recognized. The growth of IVD is illustrated by the more than 70 installations worldwide, including facilities in Japan, Europe, Australia, Canada and the U.S. Process. The IVD process is similar in sequence to conventional plating operations, requiring preparation, processing, and finishing operations in order to correctly process parts. The preparation stage consists of a degreasing operation to remove gross contaminants prior to an aluminum oxide (A1203) blast treatment that textures the part's surface and removes solid contaminants. The preparation stage also includes required masking operations. Suitable, low out-gassing masking tapes or metal foils are typical materials used. Parts are racked or barrel loaded prior to charging the IVD vacuum chamber. The vacuum vessel is evacuated to a pressure of 8 x 10-5 Torr to purge the system prior to backfilling with Argon to 2 x 10-2 Torr. At this pressure, parts are subjected to a glow discharge cleaning or sputtering operation. A high negative potential is applied between the parts being coated and the evaporation source. The argon gas in the chamber ionizes and creates a glow discharge around the parts, bombarding them with positively charged ions. This ion bombardment of the part surface acts as a final cleaning operation prior to coating. The evaporator boat systems contained within the vacuum chamber are heated and continuously fed with aluminum wire. The aluminum evaporates and passes through the glow discharge where it combines with the ionized argon and is transported to the part. Pure aluminum is plated on the part, providing a uniform, dense, adherent coating. Following the coating operation, post treatment operations are performed. To make the aluminum coating more dense, parts are glass bead peened using a No. 10 glass bead. This operation also serves to polish the coating and improve appearance. It also improves the coating's corrosion resistance. Glass bead peening also serves as a 100-pct quality-control check on the coated part. Any flaw in coating adhesion is highlighted by this operation. The final post treatment operation is a conventional chromate conversion coating that prepares the aluminum surface for finishing and improves corrosion resistance. Equipment. The IVD aluminum coating is applied in a steel vacuum chamber. Other equipment includes a pumping system, parts racking or barrel tumbling device, evaporation source and high-voltage power supply (Fig. 1). The system uses conventional vacuum technology components that are controlled with a microprocessor-based control system. The system monitors sequencing, alarms, process timing and data recording functions. Coating Properties. Coating adhesion is a function of the surface preparation and cleaning prior to coating. IVD takes advantage of glow discharge cleaning to achieve excellent adhesion of coating to substrate. Table I shows results of adhesion tests conducted using a Sebastian pull tester on studs bonded to IVD-coated test panels. Two panels were tested for each coating thickness and substrate material. TABLE I -- Adhesive Tensile Strength of IVD Aluminum Coating Specimen Tensile Strength (ksi) Panel One *10.18 9.32 *10.28 *10.27 *10.32 9.80 8.30 *10.31 9.85 *10.32 Panel Two *10.30 8.80 9.94* *6.82 *10.32 9.66 9.27 *10.30 8.24 *10.31 * The Sebastian adherence tester has a nominal upper limit of 10 ksi. A recorded adherence value of greater than 10 ksi indicates that the stud/coating specimen interface did not fail. ** A microscopic inspection indicated that this specimen failed due to substrate surface roughness. The coating did not fail. The stud could not be bonded properly to the surface. IVD provides excellent coating coverage and uniformity. It is not limited to line-of-site coverage and can produce coatings several mils thick. The IVD aluminum coating does not build up or run off sharp edges, regardless of thickness. The uniformity of IVD aluminum on regular surfaces is approximately plus or minus 10 pct of the median thickness. IVD aluminum coating thickness on the edge of a detail is virtually the same as that of the body of the detail. During coating deposition, aluminum vapor is partially ionized in the glow discharge that envelops the coated part. This phenomena creates a columnar structure within the coating. The glass-bead post-treatment operation makes the coating denser and also polishes the finished surface. Tests conducted at McDonnell Douglas using BT-10 glass beads at 40 psig produced a surface roughness of approximately 50-70 microinches. Smoother coatings can be obtained by reducing the pressure and/or media size. IVD aluminum can be used in applications where service temperatures are considerably higher than that allowed for cadmium. IVD aluminum can be used at temperatures up to 925F without any adverse effects. There is no concern with embrittlement problems as is the case with cadmium on high strength steels at above 450F. IVD aluminum with a supplemental chromate conversion coating is electrically conductive. The coating meets the requirements specified in MIL-C-81706 for the electrical contact resistance of aluminum alloy panels. This specification requires that an aluminum alloy substrate treated with a Class-three material per MIL-C-5541 shall not have a contact resistance greater than 5,000 microhms per sq inch as applied, and 10,000 microhms per sq inch after exposure to five pct salt spray for 168 hrs. The electrical measurements are made with an electrode pressure of 200 psi applied to the treated area. IVD aluminum has approximately 48 pct of the conductivity of the bulk 1100 series alloy. The aluminum coating exhibits the same alloy composition as basic 1100 series aluminum alloy evaporant. This alloy and cadmium have similar electrolytic solution potentials, -0.83 and -0.82v, respectively, when measured against the standard calomel electrode. Since mild carbon steel has a solution potential of -0.58v, both IVD aluminum and cadmium provide corrosion protection in aqueous environments. Topcoats, such as paints, sealants and lubricants improve the performance of the underlying basecoat. For example, topcoats are used to improve corrosion resistance, improve erosion resistance, or change the coefficient of friction of a finish system. The application and successful performance of any topcoat is dependent on basecoat qualities such as coverage, uniformity, and adhesion. IVD aluminum is characterized by excellent adhesion, coverage and uniformity. Evaluation of the penetration of an epoxy primer into the columnar structure of an IVD aluminum sample by scanning electron microscopy indicated a skeleton of primer penetrating into the structure. This feature considerably enhances topcoat adhesion. Both IVD aluminum and cadmium are soft coatings that are not particularly well suited for erosion resistance when used alone. IVD aluminum outperforms vacuum-applied cadmium in resisting abrasive forces and diffused nickel-cadmium when subjected to an erosion/corrosion environment. Economically, IVD aluminum can be applied thicker than cadmium and, therefore, is more abrasion resistant than cadmium. Also IVD aluminum is well suited to accepting topcoats of abrasion-resistant materials. The corrosion resistance performance of IVD aluminum has been compared to the various cadmium processes on alloy steel substrates. The comparisons have been made using neutral salt fog, acidic salt fog or outdoor environmental exposure. The testing led to the conclusion that IVD aluminum can replace all cadmium processes without exception (Tables II and III).

The absence of hydrogen embrittlement and stress corrosion cracking in these materials result in lower cost processing and higher usable strength levels. IVD aluminum on heat and corrosion-resistant alloys. Historically, cadmium or nickel-cadmium deposited on Inconel, 300 and 400 series stainless steels, and the precipitation-hardening grades receive a nickel strike to prevent the substrate from attack during plating. A readily applied IVD aluminum coating provides galvanic protection for these alloys when used in structural applications. The coatings can be used to provide oxidization and sulfur resistance up to 925F as coated and extremely high temperature resistance if diffused to form nickel and/or cobalt aluminides. IVD aluminum on magnesium. IVD aluminum applied to a magnesium substrate can be used to replace anodic and conversion-type coatings as a pretreatment for paint or solid-film lubricants. This application maybe useful in overhaul situations where magnesium parts may be assembled with other materials. IVD aluminum on aluminum alloys. The application of an IVD aluminum coating on aluminum-alloy components improves the corrosion performance of the part and eliminates the need for an anodizing treatment. The fact that the part need not be anodized allows for full use of the fatigue strength of the material. The development of microcrystalline (rapid solidification) aluminum-based alloys for high-strength engineering performance has been restricted due to the inability to provide adequate wear and corrosion resistance using traditional finishing techniques such as hard anodizing. The high-alloying-element content in these materials leaves little pure aluminum available, since a coating allows the part to be treated as a pure aluminum product that readily accepts anodic or conversion finishes. IVD aluminum is able to replace anodizing on aluminum alloys in situations where electrical continuity or bond is required. This eliminates the need for "jumper" connections across anodized fittings. IVD aluminum on powdered metals. Traditionally, sintered (powdered) metals have been a problem because they tend to absorb chemicals during wet processing. IVD aluminum, being vacuum applied, allows operators to deposit a uniform protective coating without entrapping fluids beneath the coating. IVD aluminum on bi-metallics. Dual material components requiring corrosion protection while retaining their individual material properties are readily coated using IVD. The coating is not substrate sensitive, allowing for application over brazed connections. The use of IVD aluminum is expanding from its traditional base. It provides solutions to engineering problems in fields as diverse as non-metallics and ceramics while helping to minimize pollution in the finishing industry. PF REFERENCES Holmes,V.L.

Michael P. Brennan Spartan Buff Company Spartanburg, South Carolina Technology for manufacturing bias buffing wheels has existed for more than half a century. Over time structural variations of this buff have been developed; some methods more costly than others. Regardless, material still represents a significant portion of this buff's cost and functionality. Depending on its dimensions and fabric, material can represent between 30 and 85 pct of a buff's total cost. To understand this more fully, it is important to be familiar with the manufacturing process. A bias buff can be made from a number of fabrics. See Table I for the most common materials. A roll of fabric, whether treated or untreated, is bias cut into strips. The ends of the strips are sewn together into a continuous roll. The resulting roll is trimmed to the proper length and width for the next process. At the "Iris" machine, biased material is wrapped around a large round drum (also called a mandrel, hub or core). The drum size depends upon the desired dimensions and amount of cloth in the buff. Circularly converging steel blades force the fabric into a steel clinch ring in the drum's center channel. The Iris is named for the motion of the blades. This motion is similar to a camera shutter. As the inside diameter or aperture of the blades decreases, the material around the drum is folded in half and evenly pushed into the center channel. The teeth of the clinch ring are pressed into the fabric. The resulting buff has a pleated or "puckered" face. By using biased muslin in this configuration, all thread ends are exposed to the buffing surface at a 45 degree angle forming a "V". Each thread runs from the periphery of the buff through the clinch ring and back out to the periphery on the other side. This enhances the structural integrity of the wheel while also minimizing fraying and raveling. The pleats allow airflow through the buff, which cools it and the part surface. The pleats also stiffen the wheel, enhancing cutting capabilities. Additionally, pleating engenders greater compound adherence. The amount of pleating in a buff is dependent upon the yardage in each ply of cloth. Ply refers to the number of fabric layers in the buff's face. Since the Iris's blades fold the material in half, eight layers of drum wrapped fabric are needed to make a 16-ply buff. The more material in the buff, the greater the pleating. A buff's density, pleating number, pack and class number denote the amount of pleating or cloth per ply. Assume you are wrapping material around an Iris machine's drum in order to make a 16-inch outside diameter, seven-inch inside diameter, 16-ply buff. If an 18-inch drum is used, the density of the buff is two (18-inch drum size minus 16-inch outside diameter equals two). If a 20-inch drum is used, the density or pack is four. By using a larger drum, more biased material is added to each ply of the buff. In the above example, a No. 4 density buff would have more than six linear inches of biased material per drum revolution than a No. 2 density buff. (20 x 3.1416 [p, Pi] = 62.83 linear inches; 18 x 3.1416 = 56.55 linear inches; 62.83 - 56.55 = 6.28 linear inches more material.) In total, this No. 4 density buff has 11 pct more material than the same size No. 2 density buff. The corresponding price differential should also be between nine and 11 pct. Depending on the application, the increased production life of the No. 4 buff may make it worth the added expense. Conversely, buying a buff with more density than required is an obvious waste of money. Thus, matching the right density to the application is critical. To measure the density of an existing buff, cut one strip of cloth from the buff's first ply or layer. Make sure to cut one complete revolution around the clinch ring. It does not matter how wide the strip is. Next, lay the strip out flat and measure its length. Divide the strip length by 3.1416 (p). The resulting number should estimate the drum size used to manufacture the buff. Subtract the buff's original outside diameter from this estimated drum size to derive the density; i.e., No. 2, No. 4, No. 6. By calculating the density and performing some time studies with various alternatives, you can determine which density or combination of densities maximize productivity. Because of increasing cost-reduction pressures in automatic and semi-automatic operations, there has been a tendency to equate increased efficiency with a lower buff price rather than a lower cost per finished part. Some companies are experimenting with smaller wheel diameters or fewer plies of fabric per buff in order to reduce costs. Unfortunately, many find that instead of reducing costs they spend more on the overall buffing operation due to more frequent buff changeovers, reduced finishing capabilities that cause longer dwell times and more rework. Buffing is a chemical and mechanical action. Regardless of the cloth used, cotton, sisal, wool, polyester/cotton blends, a buffing wheel acts primarily as a carrier of abrasive compound to the part's surface. Thus, for developments to be beneficial, they must enhance the buff's carrying capability or increase the time that compound can effectively be carried. A truly improved buff must cut and/or color faster for longer periods achieving the same or better (consistent) results for less money per finished piece. Therefore, arbitrarily reducing fabric content to lower costs may be self-defeating. Thread count, fiber composition and stiffness affect the abrasive carrying capability of a fabric. Cotton muslins, as well as other fabrics, have alternating warp (lengthwise), fill (crosswise) and threads (yarns). Table I delineates some of the characteristics of popular thread count materials. Thread ends act like tiny brushes, particularly in the coloring operation. Therefore, the number and thickness of a fabric's threads help determine its function. For example, 80 by 80 muslin has finer (thinner) threads. It is often used for coloring but almost never for cutting. Some manufacturers are experimenting with higher thread count materials, such as 200 "pics" per inch (warp threads plus fill threads equals the number of pics) to further utilize the brushing capabilities of fiber ends. Fiber composition is another critical factor. For example, polyester/cotton blends are being used more frequently in automatic mush buffing applications. These blends can reduce the amount of lint created in automatic operations as well as provide an excellent finish. Unfortunately, they cannot be used for higher surface speed applications because polyester has an inherently lower tolerance to frictional heat. Polyester can begin to melt causing a glazing effect. The buff will not hold compound properly. If the polyester hardens, it can leave fine scratches on a surface. With regard to stiffness, fabric treatments alter the durability and abrasive carrying capability of traditional materials. However, these treatments are costly and the resultant buff's are normally more expensive than untreated counterparts. There are two treatment categories, mill and dip. Mill treatments are applied to the fabric by a contract textile finisher or bleachery prior to biasing. The material is then converted into a buff just like an untreated fabric. Mill treatments can be applied to a variety of thread count materials. However, 86 by 80, 68 by 72 and 60 by 60 cottons are the most common. Mill treatments have a plethora of color varieties. Some are related to specific buff manufacturers. A few are standard throughout the finishing industry. Unifirm is a colorless starch treatment often used for cutting aluminum, steel and stainless steel. Yellow (sometimes called Maize) is another starch-based treatment used for cutting brass, bronze, copper and aluminum. There are also wax-based treatments that increase a fabric's compound retention and lubrication in addition to stiffness. These treatments come in many colors. They are also used for cutting applications with brass, bronze, copper and aluminum. Dip treatments are applied to the material after it has been converted into a buff. A completed buff is immersed into a vat of chemical solution. One can differentiate a dip treatment from a mill treatment by examining the thread along the bias seam. If the seam is the same color as the buff material, it usually indicates that it was dipped. Stains on the clinch ring are indicative of this type treatment. Also, the coloring of the cloth tends to be less uniform. Although a variety of stiffness levels are available, dip treatments often feel firmer than mill treatments. Buff manufacturers have created an entire color spectrum of dip treatments. However, they are usually classified as either water- or solvent-based. Solvent-based treatments build upon the prolonged life advantages offered by mill treatments. Cutting applications, particularly in automatic operations, are positively affected. Unfortunately, many of the most effective solvents are being phased out in compliance with environmental regulations. Therefore, water-based treatments have been and are continuing to be developed and refined. One problem with water-based treatments is that they add difficult variables to the process. The fabric layers of a water-based-treated buff can adhere to one another, inhibiting airflow. Solvents evaporate more quickly, avoiding this problem. However, manufacturers are already overcoming these obstacles. Recent developments include buffs with combinations of materials, such as a combination of 60 by 60 with 86 by 80 thread count muslins. Mixing certain materials in the proper proportions as dictated by the application allows manufacturers to specifically design a buff to match buffing requirements and other parameters. Assume you want a buff with both good cut and color capabilities. Perhaps a combination buff with 86 by 80 Unifirm mill treatment and 86 by 80 untreated muslin would be a cost-effective product. A myriad of possible fabric combinations can be designed for each specific requirement. This trend towards specialization is again driven by cost-conscious automatic and semi-automatic operations. As with buff density, the objective is to customize the buff so that the optimal buff cost/performance benefit point is attained. Improvements in material capabilities will continue. However, some may take place at the molecular level. Individual fibers are formed from tangled molecules. These fibers are spun into yarns. Rather than use chemical treatments, which tend to be random in nature, an ideal method for improving the fabric would be to reorganize the actual molecular structure so that the fabric has the specific characteristics desired. Imagine a material with enhanced strength and higher resistance to frictional heat. The feasibility of molecular nano-technology in textile fabrics is currently under review, and developments show great promise. Nanotechnology combines the principles of chemistry, physics, mechanical engineering and computer science. It is essentially an activity where molecules are organized in controlled, specific reactions. Using specialized biological components as mechanical devices, an assembly system can be devised where a material's molecules are altered. Therefore, a textile fabric's characteristics can be custom designed at the molecular level inherently enhancing its capabilities. In the coming years, patented designer fabrics with specialized characteristics should change the mechanical finishing industry.

The distance in feet that a buff's outside diameter travels in relation to the revolutions per minute (rpm) of the arbor. The formula is circumference of a wheel in inches (or pi times the diameter) divided by 12 (inches in a foot) times the rpm at the arbor. For example, a 16-inch diameter wheel at 2,000 rpm has a sfpm of 8,378. (3.1416 × 16 = 50.2656, 50.2656¸ 12 = 4.1888, 4.1888 × 2,000 @ 8,378 sfpm). Tangential or Contact Buffing. The positioning of the buff's periphery in relation to a work piece so that it contacts the item at a small, specific area. Generally, this type buffing is done at high surface speeds, around 6,000 to 9,000 sfpm. Excellent for cutting and coloring on a specific area. Mush Buffing. Refers to the positioning of the buff's periphery in relation to a contoured item so that a large contact area is buffed and the fabric edge flexes around the item's multiple curves. This type of buffing is done at low surface speeds, below 4,000 sfpm. Cutting or Cut Buffing. An aggressive buffing operation using mill-treated or dip-treated buffs, to remove grit lines left on a workpiece after an abrasive belt or set-up wheel operation. Generally, the workpiece's travel direction is opposite the buff's rotation direction. Coloring or Color Buffing. Buffing operation that wipes, cleans and finishes the workpiece, increasing the natural reflectivity of the surface, achieving a high luster. Softer buffs are used for this operation such as 80 by 80 muslin or domet flannel. Generally, the work-piece's travel direction is the same as the buff's rotation direction.

These counts (warp and fill) are often added together to get the number of "pics" or threads; i.e. 60 × 60 = 120 "pics" per inch. ** Yarn size refers to the yarn count system. In the yarn count system, the yarn count number is inversely proportional to weight. This system, therefore, is indirect. A 50-count spun yarn has twice the weight (thickness) of a 100-count spun yarn. Thus, 20/1 means that 1 yarn has a count number of 20. Note: The cotton muslin products listed above are untreated and unbleached. Domet Flannel is napped on both sides and is available bleached and unbleached.

By Mike Berg Product Manager Serfilco Ltd. Northbrook, Illinois With the move away from solvent cleaners and the growing use  of aqueous cleaners, many companies have encountered problems with cleaner chemistries not operating at desired performance levels. Often, much time and money are spent determining the chemistry, temperature, cycle time, pH and additives for the cleaner bath, all to ensure proper parts cleaning. These are important considerations, yet without proper filtration, agitation and oil removal, attention to these details will not adequately maintain cleaner solutions. A fresh cleaner bath operating at the proper temperature, with all other conditions perfect, will do an excellent job on the first batch of work. However, as more parts are cleaned, they deposit particulates and organic matter that render the cleaning solution less effective. As the solution becomes loaded with contaminants, no adjustment in chemistry, temperature, cycle time, pH or additives will adequately maintain cleaner performance. The most efficient and effective way to maintain the cleaner solution is to remove dirt and oils when they are introduced. The first maintenance method is filtration. There are a variety of filtration technologies available, including bag, disc, cartridge and automatic filtration. Important factors that influence the type of filtration selected typically are cost and floor space available. For light dirt-loading applications, bag and disc filtration may be adequate. Bag and disc filtration are surface loading and therefore the volume of the filter chamber is relatively large, so equipment will take up more floor space than a depth-cartridge unit of the same capacity. Automatic filtration systems, such as indexing fabric filters or permanent-media backwash systems, are also available for cleaner solutions. Automatic systems typically require a higher initial expenditure and more floor space, yet payback is achieved more quickly because less labor is required to maintain the equipment. Bag, disc and automatic backwash filters may be more economical downstream on plating or final process solutions, since the amount of dirt removed should be less than in a cleaner bath. Spent media from cleaners is typically non-hazardous. Trapping most of the dirt in the non-hazardous area minimizes dirt going downstream to potentially more hazardous solutions where disposal of the spent media could be a major concern. Often, the most economical and effective means of cleaner filtration is a depth filter cartridge. The depth filter cartridge consists of a rigid one-inch ID core (typically polypropylene) with fiber string continuously wound around the core. The result is a diamond pattern "crisscross" media with larger holes or pores on the outer diameter becoming increasingly smaller toward the inner diameter or core. The amount of fiber wrapped on the core and the tension of the winding determine the cartridge's micron rating. Lower micron cartridges are wound tighter, use more fiber, have smaller pore sizes and usually cost more than coarse cartridge media. In addition, finer micron cartridges do not hold as much dirt, fill with particulate more quickly and require more frequent changing. Higher micron or coarse cartridges use less fiber, are less tightly wound and cost less. A coarse filter cartridge with larger pores will initially pass larger particles. However, as the pore loads with particulates, the particulates serve as media, lowering the pore size and allowing filtration of smaller and smaller particles. Cleaner baths often contain a range of particle sizes and a large amount of particulates. The advantage to using coarse cartridge media on cleaners is that their greater dirt-holding capacity makes them more appropriate for the range of particulate sizes found in dirt-laden cleaner solutions. As larger particulates load the filter's pores, the pores become smaller and trap particulates finer than the filter's micron rating. To maintain solution at a certain level of clarity, cartridges as low as 15, 20 or 30 micron are often specified. However, a 100 micron cartridge provides three times the dirt-holding capacity of a 15 micron cartridge. At a high solution turnover rate, the cartridge will load with particulates that will serve as media. This way the cartridge will filter at lower than the 100 micron level with minimal reduction in flow. This method provides longer high-flow operation between cartridge changeout and higher levels of dirt removed on a continuous basis. This translates into reduced maintenance costs and fewer, less expensive cartridges used, doubling savings on a vital part of the manufacturing process. Since organic matter/oils typically attach to fiber and particulate matter, the more particulate matter removed, the more residual oil is removed from the solution. The cartridge-type filtration system is normally less expensive and will require less floor space than other filtration systems of equal and often less capacity. Cartridge-type filtration with coarse media provides the highest possible dirt-holding capacity in the smallest, most economical package when used on cleaner baths. A quality 100 micron, 10-inch cartridge holds up to 16 oz of particulate matter. Therefore, a filtration system with 60 10-inch depth-type filter cartridges of 100 micron porosity will hold up to 60 lbs of particulate matter. To properly size a cartridge-filtration system, consider flow rate, filter surface area and micron retention. First, solution recirculation rates should be at least five to 10 turnovers per hr. Higher dirt-loading applications will require higher turnover and vice versa for lower dirt loading applications. To determine surface area, a common rule of thumb is to provide at least three and a half to seven sq ft of surface area capacity per 50 gal of solution. One 10-inch filter cartridge will provide three and a half sq ft of filter area. One 10-inch cartridge per 50 gal for light dirt loading and a minimum of two 10-inch cartridges per 50 gal for higher dirt loading are recommended. As an example, a 400 gal cleaner requires a filtration rate of 2,000 to 4,000 gph and a filter capacity of 28 to 56 sq ft (eight to 16 10-inch cartridges). More surface area means more dirt removed per cartridge changeout and less frequent changing. Coarse filter cartridges up to 100 micron are recommended for maximum dirt-holding capacity. The second important method for ensuring a cleaner solution's longevity and effectiveness is proper agitation. Filtration systems will, at a minimum, double the life of a cleaner bath. While removing bulk particulates, the filtration system will provide some agitation. More aggressive agitation will assist the cleaning process by mechanically removing solids from parts. To provide a means of aggressive agitation, select a method that will not lower the temperature or introduce dirt or oils into the solution. Air agitation from a compressor or blower increases solution heating costs because the air is at ambient temperature, often lower than the bath's operating temperature. This will cause solution temperature to drop and require added heat to maintain proper temperature. Air agitation can also introduce oil and particulates to the solution from the compressor's lubrication system, and agitation from a blower will introduce airborne contaminants from the surrounding atmosphere. In addition, air bubbling up through the solution will increase emissions from the tank into the surrounding environment. For these reasons, air agitation is not recommended for cleaner tanks; nor is it recommended for many plating tanks. Liquid agitation nozzles that vigorously circulate a properly filtered cleaner bath are recommended for agitation. Eductor nozzles are strategically attached to sparger piping and cleaner solution is driven through by a dedicated pump. Using the clean, filtered solution for agitation instead of air does not introduce additional oil and dirt. More uniform tank temperatures and reduced heat stratification reduce the amount of energy required by heaters. Increased mechanical agitation also minimizes the necessity to maintain the higher temperature otherwise required for optimizing cleaner performance. Evaporation and emissions associated with air agitation are also eliminated. As eductor nozzles sweep solution across the tank floor, particulates cannot settle on the tank bottom. Particulates held in suspension are more readily removed by the filtration system and deposited in the filter media. If, after properly sized filtration and agitation equipment are installed and operating, residual surface oil still causes problems, oil removal equipment should be employed. Often, coalescers or ultrafilters are installed to remove surface oil on an unfiltered bath. Without the adequate bulk particulate removal, ultrafiltration and coalescing systems are plagued by constant plugging problems and greatly reduced flow. For a relatively small investment, a coalescing system connected to an overflow weir or skimmer assembly on a properly agitated and filtered 160F cleaner solution will effectively remove non-emulsified surface tramp oils. Coalescing systems can be run during production time or during off hours when the solution is cooler and coalescing efficiency is improved. Contact your chemical supplier for non-emulsifying cleaners to take advantage of coalescing technology. If an emulsifying cleaner must be used, ultrafiltration will effectively remove emulsified oils. Always check the compatibility of construction materials for the proposed filtration, agitation and oil removal equipment with the cleaner chemistry. Cleaners run at 160 to 200F may require CPVC, yet some new high-alkaline cleaners tend to embrittle CPVC compounds. In these cases, polypropylene is recommended, but only up to 160F. Provide chemical manufacturers' MSD sheets to your equipment manufacturer for evaluation and recommendation. Immersion testing samples may be required if compatibility data is inconclusive. Reputable equipment manufacturers will provide material samples for test purposes. By using this three-tiered approach (filtration, agitation, oil removal) substantial benefits and cost savings can be expected. First is the improvement in the consistency of final surface coating quality, which is directly related to minimization or elimination of scrap/rework. Next, a reduction of labor costs for tank maintenance can be expected. Continuously filtered solutions will not require decant, sludge scraping, retransfer and reheat of solutions. By extending cleaner life, reduction in expenditures for cleaning chemistry will be realized, and associated hauling costs or waste treatment problems will be greatly minimized. A properly filtered cleaner will also reduce oil/particulate dragin to plating tanks or other downstream process solutions. The savings these benefits provide quickly pay for equipment. Today's technology provides all the necessary equipment to achieve your liquid handling goals.

When your plating operation services a large spectrum of industries, not only do you have to be versatile, you have to be good. Paramount Metal Finishing Co., Linden, New Jersey, prides itself on the quality of its work, its state-of-the-art technology and its full-service plating operation. Michael Fuschetti, vice president of operations, describes the finishing company as "a large job shop operation that emphasizes bath and process control as the most important aspects of running a high-quality electroless nickel operation." The company plates medical equipment, machine parts, electronic component packages, connector shells, computer components and aerospace parts. A variety of substrates are plated on the four electroless nickel (EN) lines, using both racks and barrels. Plating on aluminum and steel alloys each represent about 40 pct of EN production. Zinc die-castings represent about 10 pct, with the remainder applied to special alloys used in the aerospace industry such as Invar, Kovar, stainless steels and coppers. Key Decision "We had been using a variety of EN suppliers before we made the decision to increase our EN capacity," Mr. Fuschetti said. "When market demands for more cost-effective electroless nickel plating and technical demands for high-, medium- and low-phosphorus electroless nickel coatings on more exotic substrates became evident, we decided to go with Fidelity Chemical Products." For the past five years Paramount has worked closely with its EN chemical supplier to tackle these difficult jobs. Four EN Lines To optimize production, Paramount employs four electroless nickel lines to accommodate the various shapes, sizes and substrates to be plated. The largest process line includes a 1,000-gal medium-phosphorus bath for plating aluminum alloys and other non-ferrous metals. The line has the capability of handling parts as large as 10-by-six ft and is equipped with barrels that have a 500-lb capacity. This is the "workhorse" bath because of its economy and stability. This bath is specifically formulated to provide an easy-to-operate, seven to nine pct phosphorus electroless nickel deposit. A stabilizer system provides for consistent brightness over the life of the solution. The high- and low-phosphorus baths are on the other lines, which are equipped with fine mesh barrels and racks for critical work such as air-bag components, medical instruments and electronic packages. Light metals, such as miniature zinc die-cast connectors, are run on a separate processing line with specialized cleaning cycles, strike baths and post plates. These lines contain tanks that range in size from five to 500 gal. The high-phosphorus system has a special stabilizer and buffering system that provides an ultra-smooth, non-magnetic coating. The compressively stressed deposit features excellent corrosion and stain resistance. It resists 1,000 hrs salt spray (ASTM B-117) at one mil thickness. The low-phosphorus bath is a compressively stressed process that provides a hard electroless nickel deposit with excellent corrosion resistance in alkaline environments. The hardness is close to that of stress-relieved hard chromium. Also, the deposit is uniform enough that post plating or grinding may be eliminated. Working toward ISO-9002 Paramount has made a commitment to continuous quality improvement, establishing a quality system based on the ISO 9000 series. It is taking the final necessary steps to qualify under ISO 9002, and hopes to be officially certified this year. Procedures for analysis and scheduled maintenance are strictly adhered to in all cleaning, pickling and electroless nickel plating baths. Automatic programmed processing on linear plating lines maximizes plating efficiency. On manual hoist and prototype lines, detailed travel sheets accompany all work, dictating process cycles to the line operators. An automatic controller makes additions to the high-phosphorus bath. The controller continuously analyzes for nickel metal and pH and makes replenishments as needed. X-bar and R-charts are used with statistical process control SPC software to control chemistry within set operating parameters. Coating thickness is measured with a computerized x-ray fluorescence system. Zinc die-casting expertise. What separates Paramount from many other finishing shops is its extensive experience with zinc die-cast parts. "This is a metal that is sometimes difficult to activate and achieve good adhesion of the nickel plate," Mr. Fuschetti noted. "We can plate this in two ways. One way is to plate it with a copper strike followed by electroless nickel. The other is to plate electroless nickel directly onto the zinc die-cast." The alloy type determines the pretreatment method. Zinc die-castings are used extensively in fiber optic connector shells for the communications industry where it has replaced conventional ferrous machined parts. "The reason for this," Mr. Fuschetti said, "is because it is a more cost-effective approach. The electroless nickel provides an excellent barrier to corrosion while being able to deposit uniformly on complex-shaped parts. Another forte of the company is its work with aluminum. "This was considered a tricky material to plate," Mr. Fuschetti explained. "We do not consider it tricky any longer." Today the technology is there that dispels that belief. Forty pct of the company's work is aluminum. A few years ago it was only 10 pct. According to Mr. Fuschetti, Paramount provides three main finishes, electroless nickel, tin alloys and zinc and zinc alloys, which represent 90 pct of the company's plating business. In addition, they perform robotic painting, powder coating, screen printing and assembly operations. Paramount has developed a versatile, full-service plating operation that stresses excellent results and fast, cost-effective work even with difficult projects. And they back it up with a warranty on their work.

What is involved? . . . By Gregory Panagiotakis Vice President, Technology Sherburne Metal Products, Inc. Sherburne, New York andDonald Meth Ed Meth Industries Co. Springfield, Pennsylvania Converting from copper bar anodes to baskets of copper anodes can improve the economy, efficiency and quality of the electroplating process. There may be restrictions, and it does require a bit of effort, patience and up-front investment. However, the rewards materialize immediately and increase later. More productive plating is one compelling economical incentive. Others include lower anode cost and more efficient copper use. There are fewer maintenance shutdowns and less frequent sludge removal. Any number of applications is feasible, including plating metals, plastics or electronic components in continuous operations or batch processes. Copper nuggets and ball-shaped anodes are abundant. For bars an oval cross section is most common, ranging in size from 1.5 to three inches. Rectangular shapes are also used, depending on the application and plating-line design. Nuggets are produced from copper rod of various diameters. They are chopped into different lengths. Sizes typically range in diameter from 5/16 to two inches and lengths from one-half to two inches. Metal Strip Plating One application is continuous copper plating over metal strip. The continuity of the operation accentuates some key benefits: frequent anode replenishment (even with automatic, mechanical feeder rails), constant anode surface, downtime necessitated only by bath and sludge removal. Hypothetical Case Let's assume a two-tank system is used to plate the strip on one side. Fed on rollers, the incoming metal strip first enters a strike zone. The strip fully exits this zone and continues through a two-part plating tank. The electrical power rating of the strike tank is 2,000 amps, but is operated with about 850 amps at each of two crossbars. Twenty bar anodes equipped with titanium hooks rated for 50 amps hang with virtually no lateral spacing at either end of the strike zone tank. In the plating tank, each of four crossbars of bar anodes is rated at 1,500 amps, with a maximum power capacity of 6,000 amps. Each conductor rod holds 22 bars, also without material spacing, with hooks rated for 50 amps. All anodes are rectangular two-by-three-inch cross sections, 65-inches long. The electrolyte is an acid copper bath. Conversion The mission is to replace the anode bars with baskets, but leave the rest of the plating line intact. The initial concern is to match anode surface areas so that the plated deposit will not change. A central calculation helps determine how many baskets and what size and shape are required. The calculation will take into account factors such as the number of rods in use, cross-section measures and lengths, proximity of the bars and current concentration. Several empirically derived "rules of thumb" work well to optimize the conversion. The baskets should be at least as long as the bars. The front surface area should equal the front plus one side of the bars, since the sides of the baskets are solid and ions only flow through the front mesh. Baskets should be easy to handle and replenish. The standard six-inch wide by 2.5-inch deep cross section is commonly used. Each sq inch of mesh yields more copper surface than the flat bar surface. The converted application will use fewer baskets than bars to achieve an equally functional surface area of copper. A rule of thumb suggests that the combined front surface area of the baskets across a conductor bar should be 30 pct smaller than the combined area of the front and one side of the bars. The criteria in this particular case results in the following specifications. In the strike zone, 22 titanium baskets are used to match the ionized copper level of the 40 rods. The 20 three-inch-wide by two-inch-deep and 65-inch-long bars have 6,500 sq inches of surface area. The effective basket replacement area should be about 30 pct smaller, or 4,450 sq inches. Each basket has a front surface of 6 x 65 = 390 sq inches. This means 11 baskets are needed on each of the two crossbars. Across the conductor rod, the baskets should be at least one to 4.5 inches apart or more. They should never touch. It is essential that the hooks are thick enough to carry the needed current. Titanium is a poor electrical conductor and if not properly sized could turn red and straighten. Economics Bars typically cost about 10 pct more than nuggets. Let us assume that this plant consumes about 2,500 lb of copper a month, and the bar-shaped anodes were purchased for $1.85 per lb. The annual purchase cost for the copper rods has been 2,500 x 12 x $1.85 = $55,500. At a 10 pct lower price, nuggets would reduce the annual purchase cost by $5,550. Not all of the bar material is consumed in the plating process. Although the work may be distributed evenly, the plating process does not deplete the copper evenly along the length of the rod. There is typically less erosion in the vicinity of the hook than at the opposite end. In time, this produces a spear-shape that needs replacing. Typically, bars are replaced when about 15 pct of the copper material remains. Bars also hang from hooks in such a way that not all of the copper material is fully immersed in the plating bath. Inevitably, there will be unused material at the top. In basket operations, copper material is fully submerged and all of the material is consumed. As it "dissolves," the baskets are replenished, leaving no scrap material. Selling the unused bar material back to a copper distributor as scrap recovers some of the value of the original metal, but the unused copper still represents a sizable cost. A typical scrap return of $1.30 per lb still produces a scrap cost of 55 cents per lb, not taking into account the costs related to handling, transportation and disposal. At the assumed consumption level, this represents an annual scrap cost of $2,475. The principal initial cost of the conversion will be for the baskets themselves. However, baskets can be capitalized and depreciated over a longer period of time. Baskets should last about 15 years in continuous, normal use. Efficiency Because the copper surface is maintained when nuggets or balls are used, consistently high plating speeds can be maintained. Also, the plating rate is not decreased at the rate of the depletion, therefore plating runs can be longer. Anode baskets are inspected readily, limiting labor and downtime. Usually what is on the top is also on the bottom, although sometimes shaking the baskets may be advantageous to ensure that nuggets have not become trapped in the basket. Basket Options Titanium plating baskets are preferred in nickel and acid copper baths because they do not corrode. They are typically sand blasted and/or wire brushed to a smooth surface to ensure that the bags used to retain contaminants are not damaged during installation or removal. They are equipped with hooks that are "A"-shaped for round bus bars or "C"-shaped for bus bars with rectangular cross sections. Often, rectangular cross sections are used for copper plating, usually ranging from one to three inches thick and three to 12 inches wide and 12 to 48 inches long. They are constructed with solid sides and fine, medium or coarse diamond-shaped mesh on the front and back. In many cases, the mesh, which may come in two or more wire gauges, is mounted with the diamonds vertical in order to minimize the possibility that the metal in the baskets becomes trapped. What chemical purity, shape and size anodes are ideal? Contaminant levels vary between manufacturers, mostly as a result of raw materials used (scrap or pure virgin cathode), melting process (open hearth or under oxygen-free atmosphere) and quality control facilities and procedures. Whether nugget or ball-shaped anodes are used is often determined by whether manual or automatic feed is employed. Size is determined by plating specifications. Other Considerations Conver-sion may require a week or two of downtime. A few days of fine tuning will allow operators to eventually duplicate the original plating characteristics. If tests run after the basket installation indicate too heavy copper transfer, reduce the amount of copper in the baskets (an inch or two). If the copper level remains too high, liquid composition and temperature may be adjusted instead of further separating the baskets. It is usually not useful to modify the current concentration. There are situations where conversions are not feasible because they would require prohibitive changes in the plating line. Space constraints can be one. Lines using bars typically have been operating a long time and were designed specifically for bar applications. The "work" may come too close to the basket, which could cause burning and other complications that would diminish the plating quality or change the desired plating characteristics. Most baskets are 2.5- to three-inches thick, but in many applications may be held to two or even one inch. There may not be room for operators to get into position to replenish baskets safely and conveniently without changing the arrangement of the tank. Automatic feeding systems may be implemented, including overhead feeding mechanisms. Unusual plating setups may also be an impediment. Sometimes the plating flow does not move horizontally, but vertically, or in other directions. This may preclude the use of baskets. In some multi-tank applications, a combination of bars and baskets can be used. There are obvious and compelling economic and operating incentives to consider when converting from bar-shaped copper anodes to baskets with nuggets or spheres. Reduced anode cost is, perhaps, the most important benefit. Barring major changes in the plating line, savings here will recover the cost of the conversion quickly. After that, the plater continuously stands to benefit from significant savings in anode cost and scrap, improved operating efficiency, higher quality and reduced downtime and hazardous waste removal.

By Beverly A. Graves Editor Challenge us! This attitude permeates the B.L. Downey Company in Broadview, Illinois. The coating job shop will build or alter any of its processing equipment to accomplish a job. It will custom formulate coatings to meet customers' needs. The company looks for new and different ways to apply and use coatings. This can-do attitude started 40 years ago with Bernard L. Downey, company founder and CEO. In 1954 Mr. Downey sold plastisol coatings to the finishing industry. In 1956 he opened his own shop to apply plastisols and powder coatings. All powder coating was done in a fluidized bed. In 1962 Mr. Downey installed electrostatic spray equipment for powder coating, some of the first in the United States. Mr. Downey is a powder pioneer, but the big powder "push" was not until 1974 when the Alaska Pipeline was going in and bridges and roads were laid with epoxy powder coated rebar in the concrete. Although the B.L. Downey Company did not participate in the pipeline or bridge projects, it did powder coat some large pieces light poles. In March 1975, Products Finishing ran an article on the two-coat powder coating of light poles at B.L. Downey. The process continues today. However, in 1975 the light poles were 26 ft long and weighed 260 lbs. Today the company is able to coat poles that are 50 ft long and weigh up to 1,400 lbs. The company now has two-coat powder coating of poles down to a science. The poles are manufactured at B.L. Downey Company, Inc. Pole preparation involves shot blasting with steel shot in an eight-wheel horizontal conveyorized Wheelabrator system. Shot blasting removes all contaminants, including heavy rust. Shot-blasted poles must be powder coated within eight hours to prevent rust and recontamination. Most poles are coated within two hrs. Smaller parts go through a five-stage iron phosphate pretreatment system. Depending on their size and weight, poles are loaded singly or three at a time on racks stationed at the first powder coating station. "It is quite a ballet moving these pieces around," remarked Dan Downey, son of the founder and president. Hoists and lift trucks move the massive, unwieldy poles from shot blasting to the powder line. Once racked, ambient-temperature poles are manually powder coated with Nordson guns. This ensures that the first three ft of the poles' interior are coated as well. This adds corrosion protection. This first powder coat is one to 1.5 mils thick. The posts then move into the oven where the epoxy fuses and partially cures for about five min at 500F. As the poles leave the oven, the paint is not completely cured, and the metal temperature of the poles is approximately 225F. Operators then coat these hot poles with six to eight mils of polyester powder, which melts on the hot surface. The poles then proceed into the second oven, on the same line, where they cure at a metal temperature of 410F for 12 min. The ovens are 20 ft high, five ft wide and 110 ft long. The double oven line allows for two-coat powder coating. It has also enabled the company to experiment with various colors, combinations and effects. One combination is thermoset clear powder over a colored thermoplastic powder on football face masks manufactured by a major sporting goods company. Another is red powder coating on outdoor furniture followed by a transparent black. "It requires knowledge and a certain fearlessness to attempt custom color matching and experimentation," Dan Downey admitted. All parts undergo a series of quality control tests as well. These include tests for strength, durability, uniformity and gloss. Inspections are both visual and computerized. Primary powder suppliers are O'Brien and 3M. Growing with electrocoating. Several stamping companies in the area asked B.L. Downey about electrocoating, since automotive manufacturers were specifying it for parts previously plated. The company accepted the challenge. "Electrocoating is seeing a resurgence, particularly in the automotive and appliance industries," noted Bernard Downey. "We wanted to be a part of it. That is why we are dedicated to this new line." The electrocoating equipment, from Therma-Tron-X, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, is a self-contained, automated system. Loading/unloading, pretreatment, coating and curing are all integral to the equipment. The system was shipped in one piece. While most electrocoating systems are monorail, this system is a random loading, indexing machine. "It is similar to an automated, random-loading plating line," noted Mr. Downey. In the system, parts are indexed along a slide rail rather than a traditional chain conveyor. The work envelope is 42 inches high by 62 inches long and 30 inches wide. The Programmable Logic Controller has an interactive operator station to control voltage, mechanical, electrical and fluid diagnostics. It also automatically controls liquid, epoxy, acrylic and chemical formulations. Employees can download the process data for assistance with statistical process control. The new system will coat parts with either epoxy or acrylic coatings supplied by PPG. The black epoxy is used mostly for "under-the-hood" type parts. The white acrylic is for parts that will see more outdoor exposure, such as lawn and garden furniture. If required, electrocoated parts can also be powder coated. The eight-stage pretreatment cycle within the system includes zinc phosphate and non-chrome seal from Oakite. The company chose zinc phosphate because of automotive specifications. The electrocoating system has a built-in waste treatment feature. It neutralizes acids and alkalines, precipitates metals from the pickling stage, detackifies paints, clarifies output water and concentrates solids. The new electrocoating line will further diversify an already diverse company. Forty years ago the company started with one man and a plan: customer service, knowledgeable sales people, technical capability, experience and a never ending quest for product excellence. Forty years later the plan is still working. The challenge is to do as well during the next forty years.

By John Hess Materials Engineer Chrysler Corporation Auburn Hills, Michigan Cathodic epoxy electrocoat is theprimer of choice for numerous automotive applications. Electrocoat is used on wheels, truck chassis, space frames, cross members, seat tracks, and other components. Auto bodies and service parts are primed almost exclusively with cathodic epoxy electrocoat. A properly formulated and applied electrocoat provides excellent corrosion and fluid resistance, appearance and topcoat adhesion. Cathodic electrocoat was introduced to the component market in the mid-1970's. The first generation became the industry standard, and electrocoat use grew and dominated the custom coating market. No other finish could compete with electrocoat's properties: Formation of protective films in recessed areas, providing corrosion protection in areas inaccessible by other coatings. Elimination of fire hazards, since water is virtually the only carrier. Pollution reduction, since water is the carrier, VOCs are driven to near zero. Waste is minimal and hazardous components have been virtually removed. Transfer efficiencies of near 100 pct are an approximate threefold improvement over unreclaimed spray applications. The easily automated process dramatically reduces labor costs and liabilities as well as providing a high level of consistency. The consistent finish will not run or sag during cure. Film build can be readily controlled. Cathodic electrocoat was introduced to OEMs in the late 1970's, and the needs of OEM coaters drove electrocoat development. The third generation of electrocoat in the early 1980's offered improved topcoat adhesion, appearance and leveling and higher film-builds. This enabled auto makers the option of topcoating directly onto the electrocoat and eliminating spray primer opera tions. The fourth generation of electrocoat, introduced in the mid-1980's provided reduced film shrinkage, reduced oven fouling and lower VOCs. The fifth generation in the early 1990's reduced VOCs further, while providing edge coverage and higher throwing power. A sixth generation was introduced in 1994, but the automotive parts industry proceeded directly from the fifth to the seventh generation in 1995. The seventh generation coating was designed to meet the requirements of the parts market: heavy-metal free, zero HAPS (hazardous air pollutants), minimal VOCs and possibly one-feed component. Performance requirements. Electrocoat's primary function is corrosion resistance. The most severe corrosion test is the "Volvo" outdoor scab test. The test is 12 months in South Florida at a 45 degree angle of exposure with twice daily salt spray applications. In addition to providing a pass/fail screen, South Florida Volvo testing reliably ranks materials, processes and variables of interest with regard to their impact on corrosion performance. Other less severe corrosion tests, such as scab and salt spray, are required to support the Volvo results. Cyclic corrosion tests provide fast feedback, without which, a longer Volvo exposure would be required. Salt spray testing is only required on cold-rolled steel and is included to provide a baseline for process quality control purposes. Salt water soak is included to screen heavy-metal-free electrocoats. Over and underbake cyclic corrosion tests evaluate the baked finish of the electrocoat. The cyclic scab over bare steel test evaluates the vulnerability of the electrocoat to pretreatment excursions. Low-film cyclic scab tests evaluate the vulnerability of the electrocoat at thinner films. The cyclic scab test for throwing power evaluates the actual protective throw of the electrocoat. The physical properties of the electrocoat film are evaluated using gravel, shot, impact, thermal shock and fluid resistance and pencil hardness tests. These tests evaluate the film based on the expected field exposures. Tests such as initial adhesion, humidity resistance and water soak are included, but seem rudimentary due to the performance of cationic epoxy electrocoats. These tests also serve the purpose of indicating potential pretreatment problems in the sample preparation. Appearance tests for gloss, film smoothness and color are included also, but are not as rigorous as a "Class A" decorative finish test. Operational requirements for throwing power, bath stability, and crater resistance are included as well as cure curve, coulumbic yield, rupture voltage, horizontal settling, ultrafiltration requirements, pinholing tendency and pigment feed stability. These attributes may not appear to be appropriate within an automotive parts material specification, however, to include a material deficient in these areas could jeopardize just-in-time delivery of components. In addition, an OEM materials engineer should act with responsibility to the custom coater and provide a robust material. In further accordance with this objective, the final Chrysler requirement was a line trial with a custom coater buy-off and testing of line produced parts. Performance results. Heavy-metal-free electrocoat technology has been driven by recent pending federal and local legislation. Through the course of the development effort, corrosion resistance has been the focal point. The learning curve has produced submissions of electrocoats that ranged from poor in general corrosion resistance, to poor corrosion protection over weaker pretreatment, and eventually to acceptable corrosion resistance versus the control (lead containing) materials. The latest cathodic epoxy electrocoat test results are listed in Table I. The coating met all of the requirements of Chrysler specification MS-PB45-2, including a line trial at Metokote Corporation. Electrocoat provides numerous advantages from an automotive material engineering perspective. Electrocoat has seen the continuous improvements necessary to continue its growth. The capital required to build and run an electrocoat line, precludes "dabblers" from the application business. Consequently, electrocoaters are quality conscious. The level of automation associated with electrocoat produces a highly consistent finish. The electrocoat process was originally environmentally friendly. Technological improvements have made it the "greenest" high-performance coating available. As the automotive industry moves to life cycle risk management, electrocoat will continue to be the favored finish. Electrocoat provides a relatively large window of bake and pretreatment variations under which it will still perform acceptably. High transfer efficiency, automation, low waste, and less hazards all reduce the total applied cost of the electrocoat film (ultimately passed on to the consumer). The development of seventh generation continues the tradition of high performance electrocoats, while providing a new industry standard for environmental compliance and responsibility.

By Beverly A. Graves Editor Several years ago Products Finishing initiated a survey of large paint/powder coating job shops. We expected it would generate some interest among our readers. It did. However, we found that the information remained pretty much the same each year, so we changed our survey from annual to biennial. The survey answers indicate that nearly every company is growing. Some have hired more employees, while others have added to their facilities or built additional facilities. For example, MetoKote, headquartered in Lima, Ohio, has built or acquired three new facilities and added 377 workers since the last survey. Industrial Coating Services, Indianapolis, Indiana, has added 80 employees and 145,000 sq ft of space. To make this year's survey a bit more interesting, we asked what the companies/survey respondents would like for Christmas and their New Year's resolutions. Most responded that they would like to see an increase in business or a more profitable new year. Dennis Walters of Acme Finishing in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, said that he would like to see the level of activity for custom coaters to remain strong in the U.S. Other Christmas wishes were for good employees, less government regulation and painting robots. Several also had special wishes for the health and prosperity of their employees and customers. Most of the New Year's resolutions revolved around improving the company. Some wanted better communications, such as Sabrina Burkhead of Linetec, Wausau, Wisconsin, who said that she resolved to improve communications within the company, among managers as well as with customers. Others, such as Lowell Horwedel of E/M, West Lafayette, Indiana, resolved to work on continuing upgrades of the company's facilities and personnel. Dennis Walters of Acme Finishing resolved to improve the flexibility of his production equipment and work force to achieve even faster job turnaround time. However, Thomas Segrave of American Coating Technologies in Greenville, North Carolina, said that he has no resolutions. If you have to wait until the New Year it is not worth doing. Do it now! The sidebars in the article highlight each company that responded. If you are or know of a company that should be included, let us know. The Vulcan Group was one we missed in previous surveys.

Pierce Manufacturing has new facilities that produce finishes exceeding fire-department expectations while meeting production needs of the next decade . . . By Joe Schrantz Midwest Editor One of the highlights of a typical Fourth-of-July parade is when the shiny fire trucks pass by with sirens screaming. The smiles on the faces of bystanders, especially children, beam happy approval at the shiny behemoths and their firefighter crews, who return the smiles. The parade-goer takes it for granted that those fire trucks will always look brand new, as if they had just been driven off the "showroom" floor. Have you ever seen a dirty, rusty fire truck in a parade? No way! Nobody realizes the importance of a good finish on a fire truck more than the paint-line employees at Pierce Manufacturing, Inc., Appleton, Wisconsin. Pierce, one of the world's largest manufacturers and customizers of firefighting apparatus, takes great pride in building a fire truck that will perform as expected at a fire and look good at many parades. Pride in the finish As evidence of its "pride in the finish," Pierce recently built a 75,000-sq-ft addition to its Assembly Plant in Appleton. It's now referred to as the South Paint Shop. The plant's original painting facility (the "North Paint Shop") has been refurbished to function mainly as a parts-painting shop. The expansion became fully operational in August of 1993. "We completed the project ahead of schedule and under budget," says Gerald Leath, manufacturing engineering manager, Projects and Process Group. "It was a team project, with George Koch Sons, Inc., Evansville, Indiana, acting as general contractor for the finishing system, helped by cooperation of all Pierce employees and numerous suppliers." The driving force for expanding with the new addition was production capacity. "Limited space in the original painting facility was causing production bottlenecks and requiring a great deal of overtime," notes Mr. Leath. "However, in planning for the addition, a number of secondary objectives surfaced. These included improving employee safety, paint quality, process efficiency and environmental compliance," adds Dan Ketter and Tony Hofkens, manufacturing engineers.The expansion was Pierce's first major investment in truck painting since the early 1970s, when the original paint shop was built. From the Ground Up Pierce manufactures its fire apparatus, including fire and rescue trucks, "from the ground up" at three plants employing 1,200 in Appleton. Of course, engines, transmissions, pumps, hoses, sirens, etc. are purchased. The Chassis Plant does custom chassis assembly and also builds new fire-service cabs. It has its own painting facility. The plant builds about 85 pct of the chassis used by Pierce. "We build a high-quality chassis, but will buy a commercial chassis from Navistar, GMC, Freightliner, Ford, or whomever, if that is what the customer wants," explains Mr. Leath. The Fabrication Plant produces most of the piece parts and manufactures major subassemblies, such as cabs, body panels and water tanks. It processes 6.5 million pounds of steel and 3.5 million pounds of aluminum a year. It also has its own painting facility. The Assembly Plant has 10 body lines for new production and four lines for its Service Center. The new addition gives the Assembly Plant the company's most sophisticated painting facility. A major part of Pierce's business is refurbishing previously used fire apparatus. A used fire truck, for example, may be given a new engine and new pumps and be modified to comply with the latest National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards. It also may be painted, which could include stripping to bare metal, sanding, pretreating, priming and topcoating. Bottlenecks eliminated "The new facility is paying for itself over and over again," notes Mr. Leath. "No longer do we have production bottlenecks. Required man-hours have been cut by 13 pct." "One of the reasons for this," interjects Mr. Ketter, "is that two of our booths have pits for operator access to the undersides of the vehicles. In the old facility a truck had to be jacked up, the wheels removed, and an operator had to lie down on a creeper to get underneath. Features such as dust control and improved booth lighting have reduced rework to an all-time low. The new painting facility is helping us to apply the best finish in the industry today." "The addition also improves employee safety. Dust and fume control provide cleaner breathing air and help employees stay clean on the job," adds Mr. Hofkens. "We have also brought about environmental savings," adds Mr. Leath. "The non-chrome pretreatment now used enables us to reclassify 4.9 million gallons of wastewater from hazardous to non-hazardous." "Also, the addition is designed to be energy-efficient, bringing additional savings," adds Mr. Ketter. "The filtering system in our metal-finishing booth enables us to recirculate up to 85 percent of the booth air during winter." Updating the Old Facility After the new painting facility became operational, renovation of the old 35,000-sq-ft paint line included: 1) a 3,000-sq-ft addition for a stripping bay and new parts/doors metal finishing booth; 2) a new paint booth and radiant-wall oven for compartment doors; 3) parts and doors pretreatment upgrade; 4) a new compartment-door primer-sanding booth; 5) a "response" line for painting trucks that do not fit well into the process flow of the new addition, such as three-color paint jobs. The renovated facility now has three waterwash booths and two dry-filter booths. JBI Spray Booths & Systems, Osseo, Wisconsin, undertook the booth improvements, while George Koch Sons, Evansville, Indiana, added the radiant-wall oven. The old paint facility included a section for abrasive finishing to prepare trucks for painting. The lack of dust-collection capability required segregation of metal finishing from painting operations. Operators formerly had to wear respirators and coveralls, as they literally worked in a cloud of dust. Moving vehicles back and forth across the street helped contribute to a production bottleneck. New System Layout The new paint shop has its longest dimension (350 ft) in the north-south direction, with about one fourth of the width on the west side devoted to supporting services, such as paint storage, paint kitchen and lab. The remainder of the addition houses four parallel finishing lines, each laid out in a north-south direction. Line 1, along the east side of the building, is for metal finishing. Line 2 is for applying the first color coat. Line 3 is for pretreatment. Paralleling the support facilities is Line 4, for applying the second color coat. Layout of the new lines accommodates the normal radius turns required by fire trucks. It is also ideal for the location of paint spray booth water collection in the center of the building. Pierce is gradually changing the method of moving trucks and truck assemblies through the system. Right now truck movers push a truck through the four lines, with the truck mounted on its own wheels. In the future the trucks will be painted in three sections: 1) chassis, 2) pump houses and 3) bodies. The painted sections will then be moved to assembly. The sections will be mounted onto carts that are designed to facilitate painting, including painting the underside. Line 1 At the beginning is a staging area approximately 75 ft long. This allows bringing a truck in from the cold during winter to permit warm-up before metal finishing. The next 180 ft of Line 1 is a metal-finishing booth, which has a width and height of 20 ft. It has a downdraft of 75 fpm and a makeup air capacity of 20 pct. Total burner capacity is 6.6 million BTUs. All sanding dust is captured at 99.99 pct efficiency at 10 microns. Dust is pulled down under the floor, filtered from the air and deposited in 55-gallon drums. The booth was provided by JBI Spray Booths & Systems, Osseo, Wisconsin. The booth is partitioned into four 45-ft zones, permitting work on from one to four trucks simultaneously. Every square inch of metal surface is smoothed with air-powered sanders, first using a coarse paper, followed by a fine-grit paper. Welds are ground with a coarse-grit disk. Some surfaces are filled and sanded. "The air inside the booth is so clean," says Leath, "that operators can wear street clothes and only a dust mask." Line 3 A pretreatment booth 60 ft long by 20 ft wide and 20 ft high is at the entry. Operators spray pretreatment chemicals, using a wand and water pressure of 1,000 psi. An overhead trolley system simplifies moving hoses. The booth has an access pit in the floor running almost the entire length of the booth. "This greatly simplifies spraying the truck undersides. We can pretreat a truck in 90 minutes now, while it used to take much longer, says Mr. Leath In fabricating fire body and cabs, Pierce uses galvanneal steel, stainless steel and aluminum, all of which are much more corrosion resistant than cold-rolled steel. Steel substrates receive a three-stage pretreatment: 1) combination cleaner/iron phosphate, 150F; 2) non-chrome sealer rinse; 3) reverse-osmosis rinse. Aluminum undergoes a five-stage pretreatment: 1) acid etch; 2) tap-water rinse; 3) iron-phosphate; 4) non-chrome sealer rinse; and 5) reverse-osmosis rinse. The pretreatment chemicals are supplied by Parker Amchem, Madison Heights, Michigan. A system made by Aaladin Industries, Elk Point, South Dakota, heats and sprays solutions. Updraft air ventilation exhausts mists. Pretreated trucks are pulled out of the booth into a section of line about 100 ft long, for drying and masking. Several fans directed at the truck speed drying. Workers mask numerous parts of the fire trucks prior to painting. These include wheels, windshields, valves, threads and electrical components. Masked trucks are pulled into a 50-ft-long paint booth earmarked primarily for applying primer. However, a color coat is also applied in this booth to underside areas, and a multiple-color coating is applied to compartment interiors. This booth also includes a floor pit for access to truck undersides. The booth has four stations. Operators use HVLP spray guns supplied with compressed air by plant compressors rather than from turbines. "The transfer efficiency with the HVLP guns is extremely high," Mr. Hofkens comments. Operators reach the tops of trucks with the aid of stepladders. "In planning for the new painting facilities, we gave operators the choice of using a man-lift or stepladders, and they overwhelmingly preferred the ladders," explains Mr. Leath. The downdraft waterwash primer booths recirculate 2,000 gpm below the floor to capture overspray. Incoming air is filtered to 10 microns. After they are painted, the trucks move into an adjoining radiant-wall oven. The walls of the oven are contoured to increase infrared radiant efficiency and have a porcelain lining, allowing easier cleaning. The oven has two automatically sequencing cycles: 1) a very low air movement to permit the paint to skin over, and 2) a turbulent movement of 35,000 cfm of filtered recirculated air to speed drying. Infrared heat is applied with porcelain emitters. The gas-fired oven has a heating capacity of 3.5 million Btu's, providing up to 275F. The oven exhaust is filtered to 10 microns at 99.9 pct efficiency. Line 2 Trucks entering this line have been pretreated, primed and baked. The first booth is for sanding primed surfaces with 280-grit paper to smooth out any film irregularities. The booth is 50 ft high by 20 ft wide and 20 ft high. A downdraft booth, its four exhaust fans generate 75,000 cfm, with a capture efficiency of 99.9 percent at 10 microns. Makeup air mixes in at a 20 pct rate. Heating capacity is 3.33 million Btu's. The booth is lined with a sound-deadening matting to lower noise. Before the sanded trucks are moved from the booth, they are wiped to remove all traces of sanding dust. The next two stages of Line 2 are a topcoat paint booth/radiant oven combination identical to those at the end of Line 3. The only difference is that instead of using HVLP guns, operators use conventional air-atomize guns. "We are looking into the possibility of replacing these guns either with HVLP or electrostatic units in order to increase transfer efficiency," says Mr. Leath. The topcoat includes the application of a white top, which is common on many Pierce trucks. A 50-ft space at the exit of the oven is used for inspection. Defects are removed in another sanding booth at the end of Line 2. All sanded areas are tack-wiped. Line 4 This line has another paint booth/oven combination identical to those on previous lines, except that the booth does not have an access pit. "At this point we no longer have any need to get below the truck," explains Mr. Ketter. Operators apply a second color of topcoat here. There is another inspection station at the exit of the oven. The final stage is a dry-filter paint booth, used for detail painting, touchup and minor buffing. Trucks go from here to the assembly area. The primer and topcoat are two-component polyurethanes from Sikkens Division of Akzo/Nobel, Troy, Michigan. The components are mixed automatically in a Graco Precision Mix system. The mixing is done just ahead of the guns. "While these coatings have short potlife, the proximity almost entirely eliminates any waste coating," notes Mr. Leath. The Environment The company takes great pride in being environmentally minded. It has switched to paints totally free of chromium and lead pigments. Overspray collected in the three waterwash booths goes to a 40,000-gal holding pit in the centralized waste-treatment facility. After being detackified, the waste paint is centrifuged to separate the solids. Because the solids contain no hazardous materials, they can be disposed of as non-hazardous waste. Pierce is looking for a possible use for these materials. The centrifuged water is reused in the waterwash booths. All wash solvents are sent to a recycler, who distills them and returns clean solvent to Pierce. The floors in the paint-storage room slope toward the middle for waste containment in the event of accidental spills. Pierce is in the early stages of switching to a high-solids polyurethane topcoat. The new topcoat will contain 3.5 lb VOC/gal. "We have been testing low-VOC topcoats for several years. We want to be absolutely certain that we do not sacrifice quality before making the change," says Mr. Leath. The company received two environmental awards in 1994: 1) the Governor's Award for excellence in hazardous-waste reduction, and 2) the Wisconsin Environmental Working Group and Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce Wisconsin Business Friend of the Environment Award. Quality Pierce displays its official quality policy on signs throughout the plant, in company literature and on the back of employee business cards: "The quality of our products and services is our number one priority. It is our policy to maintain unprecedented levels of customer satisfaction, to deliver defect-free products, with service second to none." "The very nature of a fire truck demands that it be built with superb quality. It must always function perfectly. Also, everyone expects that a fire engine must look good at all times," observes Mr. Leath. The plant operates under a "total-quality-management" system. "Every employee, from top management on down, is responsible for quality. We keep our own quality-control charts, and we comply with all NFPA codes," adds Mr. Leath. Every fire truck is tested before leaving the plant. "Part of our series of final tests includes running a fire truck's engine at 80 pct of full capacity and the pumps at full capacity for four hours. The customer must be totally satisfied before any fire truck leaves our plant," adds Mr. Ketter. How long is the finish on a Pierce fire truck expected to last? "It all depends on how well the finish is maintained," explains Mr. Hofkens. "We see 20-year-old trucks that still have perfect finishes, because they have been maintained well. We see other poorly maintained vehicles that look bad when they come in for refurbishing after only seven or eight years. If one had to estimate the anticipated life of a fire truck, it probably would be about 20 years." What usually wear out are the engine and pumps, requiring the truck to be sent back for refurbishing. "It's not the mileage on the odometer that is meaningful, but the number of hours that the engine and pumps have been run," explains Mr. Leath. Pierce fire apparatus operates in weather extremes around the world, including Antarctica, Brazil and Saudi Arabia. The polyurethane topcoat is formulated to be highly resistant to UV, chemicals and abrasion. The finish readily withstands 1,600 hours of cyclical salt-spray," notes Mr. Leath. "It also has excellent color/gloss retention." The company keeps painted panels under test outdoors in Florida and other locations, as well as in various test labs. "Extension" spray guns are being used to apply topcoat to hard-to-reach roof areas. "These `stretch' guns greatly help our painters control film build in these areas," Mr. Ketter explains. Pierce operates a quality-control lab equipped with a spectrophotometer and computer software from BYK Gardner, Inc., Silver Spring, Maryland, to match colors. "We have more than 150 colors, each with its own Pierce number. We can match the color on any vehicle we have produced," notes Mr. Leath. "The paint lab has a light booth that can duplicate incandescent, northern daylight, UV, and two types of fluorescent light. We refrigerate our color-standard panels in a dark place to prevent the color from fading."

Loar Group Leader Applied Manufacturing Technologies Rochester Hills, Michigan Reprogramming a complex robotic paint process results in a faster and less expensive operation... A major truck manufacturing company wanted a faster and less expensive paint process to accompany its new, more viscous clear coats. The robots on line performed a complex painting process. Adding commands would make the process even more complex. In order to simplify and accelerate the process, the manufacturer chose to reprogram its robots. Changing only one component in a robotic production process can be a costly endeavor. However, changes such as these are not uncommon. New paints and materials are developed continuously, necessitating process adjustments. Still, changeover is rarely quick and inexpensive, and the expense grows with the size and number of robots. The paint line at the truck manufacturing facility consisted of 30 Fanuc P155e Robots with controllers and Sames 60 degree bell applicators for the end-of-arm tooling. Sixteen truck body styles (eight bodies with two-tone options for each) are sprayed on the line. To accommodate the heavier clear coat, the process required recalibration of approximately 200 paths per robot, each with up to 60 robot locations. In total, more than 12,000 target locations were reprogrammed. For paint dispensing applications, reprogrammers had to consider fluid flow, the bells' turbine speed and shaping air, which controls the pattern of the paint when applied. Clogging was not an issue because it was a closed loop system in which the clear coat was in continuous motion. Mixing was not an issue either. Reprogrammers estimated that the standard manual reprogramming process, which uses teach pendants, would require up to four months of reprogramming. This included four weeks of production downtime, an average of 20 scrap trucks, as well as thousands of gallons of paint. The challenge was to reprogram this manual process efficiently and inexpensively. Repro-grammers used Tecnomatix's ROBCAD Computer Aided Production Engineering (CAPE) software tools to create the painting program. Reprogrammers uploaded an existing path program from one of the robot controllers, then calibrated the clear module and cell to work with it. After incorporating the specific truck CAD data supplied by the manufacturer, reprogrammers created and ran a program using ROBCAD/Paint and TDL Controller, a ROBCAD programming language. Variables were tweaked until ROBCAD simulated the identical film the truck maker wanted to achieve on the plant floor. These variables included fluid flow, fan pattern, target distance, robot speed, fluid viscosity, and the densities in wet and dry percentages. Once this process cell was calibrated, the path program was modified with new clear coat parameters. Following testing on the plant floor, reprogrammers uploaded the remaining paint programs from the robot and repeated the process. After the entire process was simulated and tested off-line, the new paint programs were downloaded to the 30 robots with only two weeks of production line downtime and minor manual tweaking. In just six weeks the line was operational, with a 95 pct accuracy. Using ROBCAD/Paint, AMT saved nearly $1 million, including 1,000 man-hours, 20 scrap trucks and thousands of gallons of clear coat.

Moderator: Besides the fact that the regulations require it, why should a plater/anodizer have an Operation and Maintenance (O&M) plan? Mr. Hankinson: It is important that employees have something to follow for O&M of all devices. Composite mesh pad technology is complex, so you want employees to know when to maintain them and to be aware of wash-down schedules to ensure proper operation. Moderator: What should the plan include? Mr. Hankinson: The plan should include general operation limits criteria that are important to the emission source. When I talk about limits I mean magnetic gage setting. Several O&M procedures that need to be addressed include: what you are going to do if something malfunctions or breaks down; and how are you going to comply? Three things to have in writing: 1) Checklist of action; 2) Specific work practices; and 3) Preventive maintenance plan. Moderator: Do all regulated chromium emission sources need an O&M plan? Dr. Newby: No. The regulation is only for add-on devices. If you are using fume suppressants or trivalent chromium, you simply need to follow the manufacturers' suggestions. Moderator: Which add-on devices require certain work practices? Mr. Hankinson: Composite mesh pad units, packed bed scrubbers and units that combine the two. Work practices involve a number of things: visual inspection to make sure no chromium is bypassing the unit and getting into the fans; and no drains plugged, causing solution to back up into the unit. Moderator: What kind of monitoring equipment requires certain work practices? Dr. Newby: With fume suppres-sants you need to follow manufacturer recommendations on the use of stalagnometers or tensiometers. You need to keep operating procedures available in a log book and log the amount of chemical additions. Moderator: A small electroplating operation is in compliance with regulations. If the company expands and becomes a large hard chromium plater, does it have to comply with the regulations for a large facility immediately or is there a grace period? Mr. Altmayer: You have to come into compliance immediately. You would be given 180 days to conduct performance tests on a new facility to verify that it achieves compliance. Moderator: Hard chromium platers are not required to use fume suppressants. If they choose to use fume suppressants in addition to scrubbers are they required to test for surface tension? Dr. Newby: Regulations specify that you can use any means to meet the regulations. If you use a combination of methods, you have to monitor both. You can use fume suppressants to meet regulations for hard chromium, but you must convince regulators that your plan is appropriate. You have to test for compliance, and show you will stay in compliance. Mr. Altmayer: We have tested a hard chromium electroplater that used fume suppressants in combination with a composite mesh pad system and emissions were 0.005 mg/cu meter of air. I do not know if this is a special case, but it can be done. Moderator: Is the emission standard of 0.01 mg/cu meter for hard chromium or for all chromium in a facility? Mr. Altmayer: Initially, the EPA proposed that it only be for the total chromium, but in the final rule they gave the option for total or hexavalent chromium. Hexavalent chromium, at low concentrations, is very difficult to analyze. You may have trouble finding a lab that can test for this. Since hexavalent chromium will be less, it is probably a benefit to find a lab that can analyze hexavalent chromium in addition to total chromium. Moderator: Do the fluorinated fume suppressants cause a problem with the bath catalyst? Dr. Newby: No. These fume suppressants are all anionic, so there is no problem with ion exchange or electrodialysis used for bath purification. All commercial baths operate well with these. Moderator: What air volume are you looking for in a hard chromium plating tank? Mr. Hankinson: Typically you are looking for 250 cfm per sq ft of open area. Moderator: Are sources that are given an additional five years to comply delayed from having to obtain a Title V permit? Mr. Altmayer: The deferral only applies to a Title V permit, not the regulations themselves. The dates for compliance are still in place and deferral does not impact on that. Moderator: Under the MACT standard for decorative chromium, would a Title V permit apply only to the source (chromium tank) or would it regulate an entire facility? Should you do an audit to determine if there are other types of emissions that would need to undergo the permitting process? Mr. Altmayer: The definition does not apply to any facility that needs a Title V permit for processes other than electroplating or anodizing. It is a good idea to go through the entire facility and determine what other sources may require a Title V permit and cover them all under one permit application. Moderator: Hard chromium tanks would require control devices. Do regulations say you must have certain control devices, or only that you must meet certain standards? Dr. Newby: The regulations say that for a large tank you must meet 0.015 mg per dscm. You can use any technology to achieve this that your state approves of. The add-on devices are ones EPA has named as examples of how to achieve compliance. Much of the world uses fume suppressants on hard chromium tanks, and they would not meet regulations. However, if you can negotiate with the state that your work practices will keep you in compliance and capable of staying in compliance, you will not need add-on devices. Moderator: What effect is there on air flow and volume by using a cotton mesh pad at the end of the system? Mr. Hankinson: There should not be any effect if the system is properly designed. Moderator: When you do a stack test and establish operating parameters, what variables will be acceptable? Should you do a multi-stack test to show a range of operating parameters? Mr. Altmayer: You would want to do a number of stack tests under varying conditions to establish a range of operating conditions that would still allow you to demonstrate that you are in compliance. This would give you more freedom. Moderator: How often do you have to perform surface tension tests? Dr. Newby: The regulations for decorative chromium and chromium anodize are that you must test every four hours. If you are in compliance and remain in compliance, the time period will gradually be increased to every 40 hours of tank time. Moderator: How do you monitor and control ongoing compliance? Site-specific parameters must be established for your type of system during initial testing. You need to locate where you will measure for pressure drop and velocity pressure. Observe and record the amount of control on these parameters during all later operations, as often as the regulations require. Fix any malfunctions according to your own written O&M plan. Report excesses or failures to control within your designated parameters. What must you control? Each system is unique and controls are designed expressly for each system. For untested systems, you must submit and secure the local air board's approval of a monitoring plant. The submission must include a control device description, O&M plan and site-specific operating parameters. If a company uses the control technology EPA has used to establish standards, why must performance tests be done? (Chuck Steinmetz, University of Tennessee waste reduction engineer joins the panel) Mr. Steinmetz: You have to do performance testing because EPA in its basic regulatory scheme stated that you would have to do initial and ongoing compliance demonstrations. While doing initial monitoring, EPA recognized that chromium plating sites are unique. That is why EPA seeks site-specific monitoring parameters. It also wants you to access processing parameters, such as operating temperature, current density and other aspects of plating so that all the data are parts of a written compliance report. Moderator: What is pressure drop? Velocity pressure? Mr. Hankinson: Pressure drop, when talking about a composite mesh pad unit or fume scrubber, is static pressure (collapsing or bursting pressure). What EPA is looking for is an increase or decrease across the unit or pads. For instance, if a pad becomes embedded with chromium, the pressure drop would increase. The frequency of wash down may have to be increased. The time you spend doing wash downs may have to increase. Velocity pressure is also an indicator of air flow. Kinetic pressure is taking high pressure and moving it to the low-pressure area. It is measured in degree of flow. Regulators would be looking at that as a measure of non-compliance. Moderator: What must be controlled, and what must be monitored in a packed bed scrubber system? Mr. Hankinson: Packed bed scrubbers have to control velocity pressure at the inlet and static pressure or pressure drop. Moderator: If you have a composite mesh pad system, what must be controlled and monitored? Mr. Hankinson: You need to control/monitor only the pressure drop. Moderator: If you are using a wetting agent or combination wetting agent and foam blanket, what must be controlled and measured? Dr. Newby: The surface tension of the wetting agent must be controlled at less than 45 dynes per cm. If a foam blanket is used it must be at least one-inch high. Surface tension must be measured every four hours, escalating to every 40 hours of tank operation. A foam blanket must be tested every hour. Moderator: Are there any criteria for hood caps and what prevents fugitive emissions? Mr. Steinmetz: There is no established standard for the capture, however, what you fail to capture will go into the room and impact on OSHA regulations regarding chromium exposure. Moderator: This finisher has a zinc plating operation that uses chromic acid in its zinc chromate. Recent stack tests indicate chromium emissions of 10 lb/year. Is the regulated source under the chromium NESHAP? Mr. Merony: The chromium NESHAP is specific about hard chromium and decorative chromium plating and chromic acid anodizing. Anything that is a non-electrolytic process is not covered. Moderator: What is the requirement for small decorative platers who use hard chromium? Mr. Merony: If you do not have scrubbers and it is a decorative plating tank, you can use fume suppressants to keep the surface tension below 45 dynes. Moderator: When stack testing is done to establish operating parameters for control devices, won't gages display a range of several inches during the testing? Mr. Steinmetz: Most likely, but the regulations allow you to average these and the emissions must be within a range of plus or minus 10 pct. Moderator: Up until now the talk has been about emission limits from a single source. What if you have multiple sources? Mr. Altmayer: Non-regulated and regulated sources ducted to the same stack require you to do a mathematical calculation that takes into account dilution from non-regulated sources. Moderator: Where can I get help with meeting these limits? Mr. Altmayer: The EPA has been flexible in promulgating the regulations. If you have difficulty meeting regulations, the American Electroplaters and Surface Finishers Society would like to have the data so EPA can see that the technology it says will meet the standards may not work for everyone. When testing for the standards also consider your tank freeboard and make sure you have not recently added water, raising the solution level. Also, make sure the tank loading is not high compared to normal operations prior to testing. Make sure you are not plating smooth shapes when you normally plate complex ones. Complex shapes can trap gasses and do not release as much mist. When testing, make sure the conditions match your normal operations as closely as possible. If you really have trouble meeting the standard, there is a provision in the regulation that can add one year to your compliance date. Moderator: Other problems with chromium besides air include water quality, worker safety and hazardous waste. Challenges by environmental groups and trade unions have lead OSHA to consider lowering the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for hexavalent chromium. How does EPA's rule compare to OSHA's? Dr. Newby: They are different. The EPA rule takes into account chromium emissions that leave the plant. The OSHA regulations consider emissions within the facility. The regulation deals with worker safety and will only regulate airborne hexavalent chromium, not trivalent. Platers can share any health records and tank emission data with the Government Relations Committee(1). The data can be shared confidentially.

Rinse, etch, chromate conversion tanks, lab and R&D facilities are exempt from regulations... The U.S. EPA and the University of Tennessee provided funding for a teleconference on the issue of chromium emissions and federal regulations. The American Electro-platers and Surface Finishers Society (AESF), National Association of Metal Finishers (NAMF) and Metal Finishing Suppliers' Association (MFSA), along with the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation's Small Business Assistance Program developed the conference that was telecast across the country. The conference covered the Clean Air Act Sections one through seven, Title V permits and HAPs. Panelists in Part I include Frank Altmayer of Scientific Control Labs, Don Moroni, an environmental specialist with the Tennessee Small Business Association and Dr. Ken Newby of Atotech. Moderator: What can be done to meet the regulations? Dr. Newby: The rule says any method that meets the emissions standard is permissible. It spells out specifically add-on devices: Packed-bed scrubbers, fume suppressants or foam blankets. Decorative platers also have the option of trivalent chromium baths, which are controlled only by reporting their existence. Moderator: Is a Title V Permit required for chromium emissions? Mr. Altmayer: Regulations, as they exist today, do require a Title V permit for all emission sources, even trivalent chromium sources. The industry, through its Director of Government Relations, Bill Sonntag, has negotiated with EPA to have a five-year deferral put into the Federal Register. If the five-year deferral is granted, the emission sources do not have to apply for five years. (EPA has granted the five-year deferral on Title V permits -- Editor) Moderator: What emission standard must be met under the new rule for decorative chromium and chromium anodize tanks? Mr. Altmayer: There are two options. First, finishers can use a fume suppressant and reduce the surface tension of the processing solution below 45 dynes/cm. If successful, they no longer need to do any emission testing and have no emission standards to comply with. If they do not use fume suppressants, and choose to use an emission control device, the standard is 0.01mg/dscm of air for decorative chromium platers and chromium anodizers. Moderator: What about hard chromium plating? Mr. Altmayer: Hard chromium plating falls into three categories. There are new sources. Existing sources are those that were in existence prior to December 16, 1993, and these are divided into small and large. The new sources, no matter their size, and the large existing sources must meet a standard of 0.015 mg of total hexavalent chromium per dscm. Small sources must meet 0.03 mg/dscm. Moderator: What about trivalent chromium emission standards? Dr. Newby: Trivalent chromium decorative platers merely need to tell the state that they are using this chemical, and they must use a fume suppressant or wetting agent. All commercial baths meet this requirement. Users must keep track of chemical purchases. Moderator: How does a decorative plater using this technology demonstrate compliance? Dr. Newby: For finishers using fume suppressants, they will have to measure surface tension. The most common methods are a stalagmometer and tensiometer. Using either, a finisher has to demonstrate that the surface tension of the tank is 45 dynes/cm or lower. The finisher needs to do this initially every four hrs. If he shows compliance over a period of time, this can be extended to every 40 hrs of tank use. Moderator: Are there advantages to using EPA-prescribed methods? Mr. Moroni: The regulations do not specify that these methods be used; however, if a finisher chose to use an alternative method, proof of compliance is the finisher's responsibility. Moderator: In the regulations, what qualifies a hard chromium facility as either small or large? Mr. Altmayer: To determine whether a facility is large or small add up all the rectifier capacity for hard chromium plating and multiply the sum total by 8,400 operating hrs per year. This total is then multiplied by 0.7 (utilization factor) to determine amp/hr/year capacity. If the value is greater than or equal to 60 million amp/hr/year, it is a large facility. Moderator: What kind of add-on technology does EPA regulate under the new regulations? Mr. Altmayer: EPA says finishers can use any control device. But it recognizes a packed bed scrubber for meeting the 0.3 mg/cu meter standard. For the 0.015 mg/cu meter standard, EPA recognizes advanced composite mesh pad systems as control devices. It also recognizes that a fiber-bed mist eliminator could be used to achieve the 0.015 standard or lower. Moderator: What about chemical fume suppressants? Dr. Newby: EPA allows any chemical fume suppressant that lowers surface tension to 45 dynes. It also allows a foam blanket of greater than one-inch high. This is more difficult to measure and maintain. You are not told where to measure, and the foam tends to be sucked up into the scrubber system. Moderator: When must the new standards be achieved? Mr. Moroni: For existing hard chromium electroplaters and anodizers the date is June 25, 1997. For existing decorative chromium platers the date is January 25, 1996. Any new or reconstructed source must achieve at the time of start-up. New sources started after December 16, 1993, and before January 25, 1995, must negotiate with their local air pollution control board. Moderator: Is a control device needed for a large non-electrified chromium etch tank with chromium in it? Mr. Moroni: The regulations are very specific on that. This may be an etch tank used in plating on plastics, which usually has a lot more chromium in it; however, non-electrified tanks are exempt. Moderator: What is EPA's rationale in delaying Title V permits five years? Mr. Altmayer: We approached EPA from the standpoint that the requirements for a Title V permit assume that the discharger is a major source. A major source discharges more than 10,000 lb/yr of regulated material. These electroplating and anodizing operators emit small quantities. Under maximum conditions, it might be 10 lbs/yr. EPA decided to regulate these operations based on the hazardous nature of chromium, rather than the 10,000 lb limit. We approached them from the standpoint that since we discharge small amounts, it would be unreasonable to require a Title V permit for operations such as decorative plating with trivalent and hexavalent chromium. This is an economic burden. EPA recognized and agreed with that and has decided to issue a five-year deferral. After five years EPA has promised that Title V permitting will be easier so hard chromium platers who still have to apply for Title V will have an easier time and spend less money doing it. Moderator: If a company is using less than 60 million amps, yet has the capacity to use more, can it still be a small electroplater? Mr. Altmayer: The first thing the company could do is sign on to a federally enforceable limit on the rectifier capacity, but that means it would have to apply for a Title V permit, which it may not want to do. It may install amp/hr meters and use them to demonstrate that they are using less than 60 million amp/yr, although they have the capacity to exceed that. Moderator: The company I work for has been in business since 1950 and is grandfathered on any type of air permit. If it adds to current emission systems to come into compliance with new standards, will it need an air permit? Mr. Altmayer: If EPA files a five-year deferral, then on the basis of the federal regulation you do not have to apply for a Title V Permit. However, there are local regulations. Check with local authorities. States are always allowed to be more strict and have more regulations. Moderator: Do fume suppressants cause pitting on bright surfaces? Does this make fume suppressant use prohibitive? Dr. Newby: Modern fume suppressants do not cause pits. Old ones could result in particles in the bath that may have caused pitting. Pits usually result from poor base metal. Moderator: Can meeting regulations be as easy as using a fume suppressant and fume blanket? Dr. Newby: It is only that easy if you are a decorative plater or anodizer. Hard chromium platers have to use add-on devices. Most of the world uses fume suppressants for hard chromium plating. The U.S. EPA chose not to recognize it as one of the methods; therefore add-on devices will be necessary to meet regulations. Mr. Altmayer: As I understand the regulations, fume suppressants that lower the surface tension are as simple as that. But if you choose to use foam blankets, which do not lower surface tension stack tests must be done to prove that it meets the 0.01 mg/cu meter standard. Dr. Newby: One of the functional problems with foam blankets is that when you get a thick layer of foam it entraps hydrogen. So there is the possibility of a hydrogen explosion. Also, the foam can be sucked into your ventilation system. Also, until you turn the current on, the foam blanket does not exist. So you do get fugitive emissions. Fume suppressants work 100 pct of the time. There are different fume suppressants. The old non-permanent type were non-fluorinated and inexpensive. You poured them in by the gallon. They broke down in the bath forming trivalent chromium and possibly particulates. Not too many people recommend their use, but the inexpensive price is attractive. The permanent ones are fluorinated. Most of those on the market have a thin foam blanket when in use and control by lowering surface tension. There are products out there that lower surface tension and have anti-foaming agents that remove foam blankets. This lowers the possibility of hydrogen explosions. Moderator: We installed a comp mesh pad scrubber in 1994 and conducted emission testing about one month later. Is this enough to prove compliance or will testing have to be done again when the regulation goes into effect in January 1997? Mr. Moroni: The initial performance only has to be done once, provided that you pass. It is important for anyone who does this that his control equipment be optimized. But testing is not done on a continuous basis. If you pass the first one, that is all that is required. Dr. Newby: One of the other requirements is that you have to notify your state or regulatory authority in advance of testing. There is a time period in which you have to make this notification. Possibly, if an individual ran a test and the state did not know, he may have to do some negotiating. Mr. Altmayer: It is also important that operating conditions under which the test is conducted remain the same. If the tank has been modified, if different current densities are used now than when the test was conducted, a new test is necessary. Moderator: What does EPA mean by the term reconstructed? Mr. Moroni: Reconstructed, as defined by EPA in the general provisions of the regulations, is an expenditure of 50 pct or more of original capital costs of the equipment to overhaul or add to your existing system. This is reconstruction and considered a new source. Moderator: Often MSDS indicate possible carcinogens in fume suppressants; therefore, there is some reluctance in using them. What is the advantage of chemical fume suppressants over poly balls? Dr. Newby: The advantage of chemical fume suppressants is that EPA recognizes them as a control means and they do not recognize poly balls. Poly balls have been a common thing, but they do not really cut down on the submicron particles that are the most difficult to control. Mr. Altmayer: The problem with this type of control is that you lose the balls in processing. They come out with parts and fall out of the tank. Moderator: What are some of the methods for testing emissions? Mr. Altmayer: There are three test methods for measuring emissions: Method 306, 306A and CARB (California Air Resources Board) 25, which was used as a basis for 306A. 306A is an isokinetic sampling technique that I would not recommend any plater attempt alone. You need a very expensive piece of equipment, and it is a complicated test. EPA recognized that this type of sampling can be expensive. Therefore, EPA came up with a simplified method using a sampling device that you can build yourself. This is method 306A. I would not say it is a simple technique. It is a laborious process that takes two people. You have to drill holes in the right spots in your ductwork. One person has to go up and do a traverse, which means taking samples at different points within the duct for specific amounts of time. Air samples are put through the scrubber system, and the scrubbant is analyzed by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry, graphite furnace or ion chromatography. The chromium is then quantified. You need two people for sampling and a well-equipped lab for the analysis. Typical tests for 306A may cost three to five thousand dollars. The isokinetic testing would be higher than that. Moderator: What method would you use to measure surface tension, and would you describe the measuring instrument? Dr. Newby: There are two methods. 306B uses a stalagmometer. It mounts to a piece of glassware that costs about $100. You pull solution up into the tube and count drops going out of a specified volume. The weight of each drop can be calculated from the total volume of the tube, the number of drops that fall and from the density for the sample. The problem with this is cleanliness and housekeeping. In order to get a good number, you have to do a lot of preparatory work. Also, the glassware tends to break easily, so you need one or two pieces. Measurements are made every four to 40 hrs, depending on whether or not the user is in compliance. The other method is a tensiometer, where you have a ring that you pull out of the solution and measure the force on it. This piece of equipment usually costs about two or three thousand dollars. However, it is quick and easy to use. For a plater with a large number of tanks, this would not be an economic test method because of the labor commitment. Moderator: Must you do anything else when testing emissions? Moderator: (answers the question) You must establish a range of controls or operational system parameters for the monitoring systems. Since you must maintain ongoing monitoring, the regulations specify system operating parameters needing control. But because each control method is different, no single control values have been set for these parameters. Site specific values are set for your system during testing. Specific parameters to be monitored and monitoring frequency are determined by your own emission control system.

By Beverly A. Graves Editor The Drawn Metal TubeCompany is nestled in the hills of western Connecticut. A small river ripples through the town of Thomaston, just along side the company's 40-plus year old building. Salmon and bass swim in the river, but just a few short years ago the river was virtually dead. This was not the fault of The Drawn Metal Tube Company, but a host of industries along the river. The state of Connecticut decided to clean up the river and levied regulations limiting effluent from those industries. This affected the cleaning and pickling line at The Drawn Metal Tube Company. Cleaning the copper and nickel/silver tubing involves sulfuric acid and a bright dip, along with rinses. "We used to dump the cleaning solutions into the river after treatment. We had a permit to do this," stated Gerard Chausse, vice president of production. "But the EPA decided it wanted stricter effluent limits, so we began exploring ways to comply," Mr. Chausse noted. The Drawn Metal Tube Company chose a vacuum evaporation system from Calfran International, Inc. The cold evaporation system works under a vacuum with a refrigeration unit that boils water at 80 to 90F. Rinse water enters the system at a pH of 8.2 to 8.5. After processing, pH is 7.2 to 7.5. During the process, distillate rises to the top of the chamber and solids remain on the bottom. The clean distilled water is returned to the cleaning line at a rate of 1/2 gpm. The system has the capacity to process 600 gpd. Periodically, the sludge on the bottom is automatically pumped into another tank. This sludge is boiled down further under the same type of operation. The granular sludge is then shipped off site for reclamation of the metal values. The company is exploring the possibility of putting in a smaller Calfran unit for the rinses after the copper bright solution. This unit processes 50 gpd. "Pumping the rinses through a single unit would allow us to recover the copper and water and reuse both in a fresh batch, saving money on the long run," stated Brian McAdams, maintenance supervisor. The cleaning line also features counterflow rinse tanks. Fresh water is added occasionally to make up for evaporation due to open air. This amounts to approximately 300 to 500 gal per week. Installing the vacuum evaporation unit has saved The Drawn Metal Tube Company money and also helped save the river. Mr. McAdams can tell you that. He catches bass and salmon in it regularly.

Product Finishing Staff For fast turnaround and consistent quality control, the manufacturing process must be controlled. It makes the difference in high-quality, high-volume, "in-spec" fastener plating. Plating fasteners and metal parts for use in many industries and meeting high quality standards are what Jagemann Plating does well. The Manitowoc, Wisconsin, company plates millions of parts per week for the automotive, commercial, medical, housewares and general consumer industries as well as the Navy. It provides 8,000 to 15,000 lbs of plated fasteners per week. Eight semi-trucks leave the company's plant each day. Jagemann plates EPI, Inc. copper, MacDermid nickel, bright nickel, hard chrome and chrome, Enthone bright zinc (both cyanide and alkaline), and applies JS500 (MacDermid silica-type sealer) and Alodine chromate coatings from Parker Amchem. It also provides metal finishing services such as polishing, bright dipping, degreasing, lacquering and salt spray testing. The company is best known for chloride zinc and nickel chrome rack and barrel plating, according to Todd R. Hacker, quality control manager. Parts plated range in size from a washer pin having a 1/8-inch diameter to four-ft by eight-ft steel sheet. The company started business on December 3, 1945, in a building the size of a two-car garage. Its founder was Joseph C. Jagemann. His philosophy was to give the best quality and service to the customer, while providing a competitive price. This philosophy is still followed fifty years later. In 1950, the company moved to its present location on South 26th Street in Manitowoc. Over ten expansions have taken place since that move. "Many of the changes have occurred because of government regulations and the technical plating needs of our customers," said Arthur N. Jagemann, who became president of the company in 1976 after his father's death. Since then, he and his employees have taken Jagemann Plating Company to its present prominent position by tackling new markets and positioning it for the year 2000. The Jagemann plated fasteners vary by industry and application. For the automotive industry, Jagemann plates ferrules and inserts for hose assemblies; mounting clips and related hardware and fenders as well as brake disks. Also, for the fastener industry a volume of various nuts and bolts are plated. The company also plates fabricated laser assemblies. For the medical industry, bed frames, platform and related hardware are plated. Also, frameworks, panels and housings are finished. For the housewares and commercial industries, Jagemann plates everything from flag pole holders to the total internal mechanism for paper dispensers. For the home, lawn and garden market, its plating includes blades, handles, and fastening caps for scissors, pruners and related products. Bases for saws and rollers for tread mills are also plated at its plant in Manitowoc. "We have to meet the stringent specifications set by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, plus Navy specifications. Quality control is based on Mil-Std 45662 and Mil-Std 105D," stated Mr. Hacker. "Key to our plating volume and high quality is controlling the input into the plating processes and continuous inspection of the plating thickness of the fasteners and parts. Parts are plated on either an eight-bay Jessup automatic barrel line or our 16-bay Jessup automatic rack line," reported Mr. Hacker. In process, parts from the plating company's load area are processed through a series of cleaner and acid baths prior to going into the plating stage. The fasteners and parts are first tested with a MFX plating thickness tester from CMI International as they emerge from the plating bath and prior to chromating. This helps operators set up the plating process for proper plating time. The table-top tester combines eddy-current and magnetic induction for checking the plated fasteners and parts. The eddy-current mode provides Jagemann with high accuracy thickness measurements of copper, zinc, and electroplated nickel over ferrous metals. The tester is used primarily on zinc chloride and Watt's nickel plating. The zinc barrel plating consists of 40 to 120 lbs per load. Every five minutes plating operators test samples from each load. Once the proper plating is determined, the master timer is set to control the plating process. Every barrel of plated parts is again tested before drying. "Once around to the QC audit area, a visual and plating thickness test is again made. All necessary certification reports are printed and provided to Jagemann's customers. The need for restandardizing different types of plated steel parts has been eliminated. Plating fasteners, as a rule, is specification plating for our company. Customers will not accept any roll-over of fastener threads due to excessive barrel plating. This tester plays an important role when walking this fine line," explained Mr. Hacker. "Quality Control is not an easy street to walk, but with consistent testing and knowing that the plating thickness readings meet our customers' specifications quality remains top-notch at Jagemann," concluded Mr. Hacker.

The Senate will soon consider a bill concerning one of the most serious problems you face in trying to comply with all the environmental laws and regulations. Namely, how your efforts to comply may expose you to serious fines and damaging litigation. A self-initiated audit can bring you into compliance, but there is a possibility the audit could become evidence for regulators, litigants and prosecutors. For example, WMX Technologies, Inc., Oak Brook, Illinois, operates waste management and environmental treatment and disposal facilities in 47 states. In October, 1992, an employee voiced concerns that a company inspector had falsified records of lab packs received at Chem Waste's St. Louis incinerators. The company investigated, corrected the problem and reported it to state agencies. Instead of hearing, "OK. We are glad you fixed it," from regulators, the state of Illinois penalized the company $1.5 million and then upped it to more than $4 million as punishment for several other examples of non-compliance at the facility. This information was reported in Resources, April 1996. The finishing and related industries are not the only ones that have been affected by "confessing" unintentional emissions or paperwork mistakes. Coors Brewing Company has obtained a permit to operate its Colorado brewery based on emissions modeling from two sets of guidelines used by the EPA and the states. In late 1990 the company measured the VOCs in the brewing operations. The company spent 18 months and $1.5 million on the study and found that emissions were 650 tons per year, rather than the 40 tons per year estimated under the permit guidelines. Coors reported the emissions to the Colorado Department of Environmental Protection. It was fined $10.5 million for not being properly permitted and an additional penalty to offset the company's supposed economic gain from the alleged non-compliance. This was also reported in the same issue of Resources. Scary, isn't it? That is why Senators Mark Hatfield and Hank Brown have introduced Senate Bill 582, the Voluntary Environmental Audit Protection Act. This is meant to increase your confidence that information gathered in good faith will not be used against you. The bill provides limited evidentiary protection for self-audits and eliminates penalties for entities that uncover non-compliance as the result of an audit or compliance-management system; voluntarily disclose this non-compliance to the regulatory authorities; and move promptly to correct the non-compliance. Manufacturers need to make their case now that environmental compliance is enhanced by making it easier for you to bring yourself into compliance. Write your senators and ask them to support S.582.

Thomson Consumer Electronics is the world's fourth largest consumer electronics company. It pioneered color television, and today it manufactures RCA, General Electric and other top-of-the-market sets for distribution worldwide. The company's Indianapolis facility molds and decorates more than 2.5 million polystyrene cabinets per year. The sets are assembled in Bloomington, Indiana, the largest of the company's two manufacturing plants. Cabinets for sets up to 32 inches diagonal are molded in black and then masked and painted on the front side with a suede-like finish. Paint masks have long been a critical component in repetitive decorative painting. Keeping masks clean is one of the most important factors in achieving a crisp paint line. In the past, when solvent-borne paints were used more often, the most common method of mask cleaning used volatile solvents with low vapor pressures. This resulted in significant loss through VOC evaporation. Generally, this was 50 to 60 pct of the total volume after two average production shifts. If the system started with 100 gal of reclaimed solvent, 40 to 50 dilute gal of paint and solvent would have to be removed from the mask washer, stored and distilled. After distillation and paint separation, 25 to 30 gal of reclaimed solvent would be returned to the system. After reclaiming the solvent several times, virtually all of it was lost to the environment. In 1989, Thomson made a company-wide commitment to switch to 100 pct solvent-free finishing. As a first step, the company sought a solventless mask washing system that would perform well in a short processing cycle and be compatible with an existing solvent-borne paint system. In 1993, Thomson took a second step in its transition to solvent-free finishing by replacing its solvent-borne paint with a water-borne epoxy hybrid enamel. This required a change in mask-washing chemistry. A team from Thomson, headed by process engineer Ervin Simons, contacted Challenge, Inc., Indianapolis, Indiana, for assistance. The Thomson team and Challenge chemists developed a mask-washing chemistry that allowed the company to complete the third and final phase of its transition. 633-S is a one-step process based on a cationic polymer. This water-borne barrier coat system is pH stable, non-foaming and biodegradable. With the system, an aqueous solution of film-forming material is applied at 180F to the mask using pressure spray and then dried. Following spray painting, the mask is sprayed again with a film of the same aqueous solution, removing the paint and simultaneously redepositing a new film onto the mask. The system is based on a proprietary polymer molecule and combines the environmental safety and material cost advantages of water-based chemistry with fast cycling. A typical wash and dry cycle is three min or less. Mr. Simons was involved in the decision to implement the original solvent-free mask washer and to upgrade it later. Mr. Simons explained, "The original system allowed effective barrier coating and shielding, but when the water-borne paints were introduced it caused the paints to dissolve into their natural components of paint and water. This created a maintenance headache. Also, it was time consuming and costly to manage. "Because it was created specifically for the water-borne paint," said Mr. Simons, "the newer system converts water-borne paint into a semi-solid that is easily filtered." When using the water-borne mask washing on solvent-borne paint, mask washers were cleaned out every six weeks. Using the new product, the mask washers are cleaned once a year. Debris does not accumulate in the bath and the bath chemistry does not demand routine dumping and recharging, only filtration. However, there were some bugs to work out at the beginning. The semi-solid condition of the paint is actually a crystallized form. Because of this, Thomson found that it needed a basket to capture and filter the crystallized material as well as a stainless steel screen. Valves and joints also had to be stainless, because the water-borne material would adhere to galvanized surfaces and harden. In his 18 years of service at Thomson, Mr. Simons has earned a reputation as an innovator. "Ninety pct of the improvements we have made are things I have instigated," he admitted. Thomson is satisfied with both the product performance and the cost benefits. Mr. Simons noted that material costs in most parts of the country are similar; the difference is in the number of bath changes. Mask washing improvements, such as pressure-flood mask washing and high-energy spraying, provide for the removal of two-component coatings and other tenacious finishing systems from the mask washer as well as from tooling and machinery. Paint solids accumulated after filtration can be disposed of directly in the sanitary sewers in most communities with no adverse environment consequences or fees.

By Daniel T. Regan AAC Engineered Systems, Inc. Cinnaminson, NJ It is not the latest Internet on-ramp. It has no relationship to anything that was "developed by a team of NASA scientists for the space program." Still, it does share something in common; it is an emerging technology for the mass-finishing industry. It is centrifugal disc finishing. Remember the earliest days of personal computers? No one quite understood them, or if having one was necessary. Now, it is hard to find a desk without one. Like many other emerging technologies, centrifugal disc finishing has spent a long time in development. A recent, "non-scientific" survey of manufacturing professionals at an industry trade show revealed that about only five pct had any idea what centrifugal disc finishing (CDF) was. More surprising, the question was asked while the attendee was standing less than eight ft from a unit. The following are the 10 most frequently asked questions about centrifugal disc finishing (CDF). 1. Where did centrifugal disc finishing originate? Some say that mass finishing began with the ancient Roman armies. Riding and marching to battle, the centurions carried their swords, shields and armor in burlap bags containing sand, leather and river stones. As they hiked, their armaments were burnished to a high shine. Exploiting the result, Roman armies favored early morning attacks, on an open hillside, facing east. Even a small battalion appeared as an enormous force. This points out two interesting facts about today's metal product finishing industry: 1) metal product finishing has changed much since then; 2) it really has not changed much at all. The fundamental problems of shining dull metal, smoothing rough metal and softening sharp edges have not changed. The basic solution of parts, abrasive finishing media, and water is almost identical. What has advanced is the machinery used. The right tool for the job. Until about 1950, the primary tool for mass finishing was the rotary tumbling barrel. These slow-moving, open-ended tumblers may date back as far as feudal China, reportedly first used in making gunpowder. They were and still are effective, but slow. Mass finishing got a shakeup in the 1950's when vibratory finishing first appeared. Debuting in Europe, this method uses an eccentric weight and rotating shaft to forcibly shake the parts-media mass in a tub. Vibratory finishing shortened time cycles. It became the unquestioned standard for mass finishing, where it remains in many manufacturing facilities today. The high-energy revolution. In the mid-1960's, the rules changed. Finishing machinery manufacturers discovered and harnessed "high-energy." This was a major improvement upon the gravity-dependent tumbling barrels and vibratory systems. In centrifugal barrel finishing (CBF), operators place parts and media into a closed barrel attached to a processing turret. As the turret rotates at high speed, the barrels counter-spin against the turret's rotation. This action delivers high levels of centrifugal force, up to 25 g's (1g = one time the force of gravity). Parts were now finished in minutes. With CBF, finishers could exert tremendous finishing forces on a part while also tightly controlling the finishing operation. Frustrated with the material handling barriers of centrifugal barrels and the lengthy time cycles of other methods, finishers needed a new approach. They wanted something that could offer the "best of both worlds," high process speed and control plus material handling that fit in with manufacturing automation. Debuting in the U.S. in the early 70's, the centrifugal disc was the beginning of the answer. Centrifugal disc's answers often raised more questions. 2. What is Centrifugal Disc Finishing (CDF)? The basic technology is just about as simple as your kitchen blender. Rather than blades crushing ice inside a pitcher though, a round rotating disc resides at the bottom of a round stationary chamber. Fill this chamber to its working capacity with your parts plus any or all of the following: finishing media, water and liquid or dry compounds. When you energize the machine, the disc's rotation forces the entire mass to rise quickly upward and outward. The walls of the upper processing chamber slow the mass, effectively "braking" it, turning it over upon itself to tumble down and inward back to the disc to begin again. The mix takes the shape of a vortex of parts, water and media. The centrifugal force developed by the disc adds weight to the parts and media. The result is a highly aggressive parts-finishing energy. Depending upon the size of the machine (smaller machines require higher speeds than larger ones) this action will take place at anywhere from 60 to 250 rpm or more. In many machines, the rpm speed is variable, allowing the operator to vary processing forces from one part or process to the next, while maintaining the optimal "shape" of the finishing mass. 3. Why should I consider a CDF system? As the real estate business has the "three L's," (location, location, location) the answer to this question is in the "three R's" (results, results, results). Generally, a centrifugal disc will finish parts eight to 10 times faster than a conventional vibratory bowl or tub. A two-hr vibratory cycle could be done in 12 to 15 min. Viewed another way, a two cu ft centrifugal disc could do the work of a 20 cu ft vibratory system in about one-half the space. Speed is not the only issue. Response and flexibility have become the new watchwords for component manufacturers. JIT delivery and cell manufacturing demand it, with their emphasis on greater numbers of smaller orders. The centrifugal disc is flexible. By varying media, water, parts/media ratios, machine fill level, disc speed and cycle time, a CDF system allows effectively infinite finishing results for different parts and finishes. The rapid time cycles allow a complete changeover when the current processing cycle ends. 4. What is the benefit for my processes? CDF offers efficient material handling and process control. Material handling is critical to maximizing CDF output. (After all, what good is a five-minute processing cycle that takes a half hour to separate and reload?) Only one thing guarantees no parts mixing between finishing cycles, emptying the contents of the system; media and all. In CDF, the process chamber empties quickly and completely between cycles. With integrated screening, conveying and loading, a new process batch, with different parts and even different media, can be loaded in an empty machine in minutes. With a quick adjustment of cycle time and disc speed, an entirely new process can be set up and running quickly. The resulting surface finish is also different. In CDF, the parts/media vortex creates a powerful sliding action in the finishing chamber. Compared with the peening action of vibratory finishing, the result is often a smoother surface finish. Also, unlike its closest cousin, centrifugal barrel finishing, the open top of the CDF process chamber allows easy in-process quality inspection and "on-the-fly" process adjustment. 5. What media can I run in it? If you can run it in other systems, you can usually run it in a CDF unit. Ceramic, plastic, synthetic, porcelain, sintered, fused and random nuggets, grits, steel and agricultural media all work successfully in a properly designed and maintained system. It can work for part-on-part applications as well. The aggressive centrifugal disc action allows some media combinations that are impossible in other systems, which can allow media of different weights to separate from each other during processing. If you are responsible for cost management, the following will interest you. All things being equal, a centrifugal disc can use a less aggressive media to do the same work as other methods. "Less aggressive" generally translates to "lighter," and that normally means a lower price per cu ft. It also means lower overall attrition rates, and that delivers lower cost over the long run. 6. What kind of parts can I put into a centrifugal disc machine? CDF finishing is not the cure for all finishing ills. A centrifugal disc system is most effective with high volumes of small compact parts (generally not delicate or large, heavy work pieces). A good guide is "smaller than your fist, lighter than a pound," with some exceptions. Several jet engine turbine blade manufacturers successfully use large CDF systems to finish massive parts, some a ft or more long, weighing five or more lbs. each. The centrifugal disc works best on parts requiring external burr removal, edge-breaking, radiusing, overall material removal, smoothing and burnishing. 7. What sizes of CDF machines are available? No industry standard exists for listing machine size, so you must become familiar with two terms: machine (or overall, bowl or total) capacity and working capacity. Total machine capacity is simply the volume of the entire process chamber/disc area. However, the disc's rotation forces the bowl's contents to rise and tumble into a vortex. Therefore, the total machine volume is not available for use. The term working capacity describes the maximum amount of parts and media that can run without any of it flying out of the bowl. Using working capacity, CDF systems can be found in sizes ranging from one-half to about 10 cu ft. The right machine size will depend on a combination of throughput requirements, part size, desired finish and budget. 8. CDF is faster, so it must be expensive, right? A CDF system, measured on a cu ft-for-ft basis, can cost five to seven times as much as a same-sized vibratory system. On the other hand, it could do 10 times the work in the same amount of time. It is the same with consumables. Obviously, as you do more work, you will expect to use more finishing materials. For instance, vibratory systems use about one to two gal of water/cu ft/ hr, while CDF will use around five to six gal/cu ft/hr. Media will break down faster, but not ten times faster. While direct comparisons may seem difficult, diverse finishing options can be analyzed using "cost per part"factoring. To derive this number, add machine purchase price, consumables used, waste handling, maintenance, labor costs and other overhead factors, then divide the sum by total parts throughput. As labor and fixed overhead costs continue to rise, CDF can often produce favorable cost per part results on the strength of its speed and flexibility. 9. What is all this fuss about "the gap?" If you know anything at all about CDF, you have heard complaints, arguments or theories concerning the spinner/chamber gap. If one surface is going to rotate and the other remains stationary, something has to give. What "gives" is a very small space between the rotating disc and the upper process chamber. This gap begins at a width of 10 to 20 thousandths of an inch or even less. With use, and often abuse, the gap tends to widen slowly throughout the machine's life. Eventually this can cause considerable trouble, such as media lodging, parts jamming and damage, or other machine failure. If you consider purchasing a CDF system, pay special attention to gap design and the manufacturer's ability to renew, replace, or adjust this or avoid trouble in the first place. 10. What features do I look for in a centrifugal disc machine? Look beyond the purchase order. Buying a machine is only part of the battle. Centrifugal disc finishing is an aggressive process. The machine endures much abuse and turns a heavy load at high rotational speed. The by-products are significant torque forces and high stress. To handle this, the disc-drive system must be powerful and reliable. Overall machine construction must be sturdy and preferably contain as few moving parts as possible. Under the heading of reliability comes maintenance. Quiz your sales engineer and make him show you the answers. How easy is the system to service? Are maintenance points easily accessed? Are potential problems easily diagnosed? When a component fails can I get a new one quickly and preferably locally? What routine problems might I encounter, and how do I recover from them? How much of the machine set up, routine and restorative maintenance can my own people do with current tools and knowledge? Remember, in CDF parts are finished aggressively. The two main contact surfaces, the disc and upper chamber, work in a highly abrasive environment. Therefore, many conventional wear-resistant materials used in vibratory or tumble finishing are ill-suited to the task. Learn how long these surfaces are expected to last, and the cost and lead time of renewal or replacement. Get good help. Know that you are not on your own. Seek out a manufacturer or sales professional who can help you with the research. Good ones can develop a custom process for your part, or improve a current one. They can suggest ideas to mechanize or automate your system and accurately recommend action based on solid technical knowledge. More than likely, they already have experience with related applications. Use their prior work to your advantage. The finish line. Since you have made it this far, you deserve a bonus question. Question 11: Is centrifugal disc finishing right for me? Naturally, there is no firm answer. For many finishing professionals though, the answer is becoming "yes." As competition for customers becomes more fierce, and margins for production errors and waste shrink, CDF provides the flexibility that many manufacturers need. The only way to know is to try it. The results will speak for themselves.

By Beverly A. Graves Editor Rarely do you see a lone Harley-Davidson motorcyclist roaring down the road. More often there are three or four riders cruising together. They are allied by their devotion to riding Harley-Davidson motorcycles. This attitude pervades the Harley- Davidson facility in Tomahawk, Wisconsin. Employees work as a team. They are joined by their desire to produce the best plastic parts possible for Harley-Davidson motorcycles. These parts include saddle bags, sidecars and fairings, among other parts. Any problems with molding, prepping, buffing, painting, detailing and packing are handled by teams. These teams also work with all the other teams at Tomahawk to make sure everyone is pursuing the same end result, a quality, defect-free product. When Harley decided to put in new paint lines, it worked with its suppliers as a team. Because this particular facility is not large, some of the "big" suppliers were not interested in working with them, noted Chuck Statz, project engineer. Three paint lines, manufactured by F Systems, Lynn, Indiana, were installed by a local company, Stainless Specialists, Wausau, Wisconsin. One paint line is dedicated to finishing parts and accessories, particularly for the aftermarket. Two other lines are assigned to production parts earmarked for final assembly. The fourth line is for clear coating. Although the paint lines are basically devoted to specific models, any part in the facility can be run on any line. This gives the Harley-Davidson Tomahawk facility the flexibility it needs. Three types of plastics are used for the parts. SMC is supplied as plastic sheet. Harley purchases parts made from ABS and GTX 902, a thermoset plastic, from Windsor Plastics, Evansville, Indiana. The sheets of SMC are cut, rolled, weighed and placed in the 500-ton press. Specific temperatures and pressures are maintained when molding the parts, because this can affect part quality and subsequent painting processes. After molding, SMC parts are trimmed and scuff sanded. Visible pin-holes are filled with putty and wet sanded. The parts are then drilled for any hardware (hinges, latches etc.) that will be added. GTX 902 parts are not sanded. But, because this type of plastic holds more static electricity charge than the others, it is wiped with a destat cloth immediately as it is unpacked. ABS blanks are routed and sanded. Parts are transported on carts. Unlike other Harley-Davidson facilities, where conveyors are king of the road, Tomahawk prefers to use carts (except for the finishing line). "This gives us flexibility and allows us to respond to changes more quickly," stated Mr. Statz. At the finish line employees rack parts on fixtures specifically designed for each plastic Harley part. All fixtures, manufactured by Thermal Clean, Chilton, Wisconsin, are stainless steel. The fixtures mask off the interior of the parts to keep them free from overspray. Also, specially designed ABS inserts keep deep part recesses (like those on the saddle bags) free from overspray. Harley-Davidson customers are quite particular about the finish on their motorcycles. This has caused the company to be just as particular, if not more so. The inverted continuous chain conveyor from Rapid Industries runs at eight fpm. The inverted conveyor helps keep down dirt that could fall on the parts from an overhead system. Both primer and color coats are applied on the same line. On the first pass through the system, parts enter the first of two small booths preceding the main spray booth. In the first small booth workers manually wash the parts using lint-free cloths soaked in an isopropyl-water mixture. The solution also contains a one pct destat agent. In the second booth, parts are tacked off manually to remove any dust or dirt. The entrance and exit to the tack-off booth have a deionized air blow-off to further eliminate any static charge on the plastic parts. Humidity in the paint room is maintained at 50 pct, and in the booths it is 65 pct to help eliminate static. Employees use Mattson HVLP spray guns to apply a two-part epoxy primer from PPG. Two spray painters each apply 0.5 mil of the primer. After application, primer flashes for eight min. Primed parts then proceed through eight min of infrared to "skin over" the paint. The infrared system was purchased from Fostoria Industries. This "skinning over" keeps out dust and other contaminants that may be present in the more turbulent air of the convection oven, where parts cure for 24 min at 195F. The "skinning over" process is important because the high-solids paints (color coatings) tend to stay wet three-fourths of the way through the radiant-cure oven before developing a good "skin." The lower-solids urethane coatings flash quickly and, therefore, develop a "skin" quickly. After the primer cures and cools, employees inspect the parts for pin holes or other imperfections. Together, Harley and PPG developed the primer color and gloss so it would show pinholes or other minor defects after curing. Usually the primer reveals about nine to 15 pct of additional pinholes in the substrate that were not visible during the initial sanding and prep. So parts are again filled with putty and wet sanded. Because the parts are still warm, the putty cures quickly. Parts then enter the same wash and tack off booths in preparation for color coating. However, parts are washed only with water. Isopropyl alcohol would soften the epoxy primer because the paint is not completely cured. "An alcohol wash would make the primer too soft to paint over," noted Randy Christianson, paint line engineer. "But a week from now it will be cured enough that you could dip it in acetone and nothing would happen." Employees use the same type of guns to apply the high-solids color or solvent-borne metallic coatings. There are separate guns and fluid handling systems for different paint chemistries. Color changes require one minute. Spray gun operators remove the primer hose, flush out the gun with a solvent hose and then hook up another gun to the color line. Each booth has six hose lines: one epoxy; one acrylic; two urethane, solid color; and two urethane, metallic. Color coated parts cure at 195F under the same conditions and procedures as the primer. Cooled parts follow one of two routes. Parts receiving a candy coat (a transparent color over a metallic base) remain on line. Finished parts are taken off line and loaded onto carts. Employees wheel the carts to the pin striping area. Here, workers hand detail the parts with color-coordinated stripes. Specific fixtures align the stripes. Special paint pens allow pinstripers to "roll on" the striping paint. All base colors and detailing colors are coordinated with the colors applied to metal parts at Harley's facility in York, Pennsylvania. The Tomahawk facility also makes and finishes parts for models going back five years. It also has developed colors to match 25 to 30 police departments around the country. Mr. Christianson noted that the South often uses greens, while places such as Kansas and Virginia prefer gray and blue. The detailing (pin stripe) paint air dries before workers cart parts to the clear coat line. Here solid color parts are wet sanded and wiped down with a 50:50 water, isopropyl alcohol wash. The alcohol helps evaporate the water, which could cause streaking in the finish. On the clear coating line, a DeVilbiss P100 robot clear coats all the parts. A metal flag on each fixture "signals" the robot as parts enter the booth. This signal tells the robot what program to follow. Following clear coating, parts flash off for seven min and cure for two and a half min in an infrared oven and then pass through six min of heated wall prior to entering the 195F convection oven for 22 min. The line runs at seven fpm. All paints cure at 195F, no matter what the substrate is. The GTX 902 plastic can withstand temperatures to 312F and the SMC has a 270F ceiling, but the ABS can warp at about 190F. Special fixtures keep ABS parts from distorting at the 195F cure temperature. To verify oven temperature consistency, Harley uses a Datapaq Oven Tracker system. The system records oven temperatures from start to finish, traveling with the parts. It shows Harley how long it takes parts to get up to temperature, as well as revealing any hot or cool spots in the oven. Once clear-coated parts cool, employees transport them via cart to the buffing area. Here, buffers buff parts using a 3M Finesse system. Hardware is attached and parts are loaded and shipped to York, Pennsylvania, for final assembly. Keeping the Tomahawk facility running smoothly revolves around plant flexibility and dedication. Dedication like you find among Harley-Davidson riders roaring down a stretch of country road, perhaps on their way to Tomahawk.

Why fix it, if it isn't broken? . . . Late in 1995, Toledo Deburring Company passed an important milestone when its annual parts volume topped the 100-million mark for the first time. Toledo Deburring, and its Livonia, Michigan, sister company, The Deburring Company, finish ferrous and non-ferrous stampings for automotive, medical/dental, luggage and appliance manufacturers. Toledo Deburring is true to its name, and much more. In addition to deburring, the company performs vibratory cleaning and polishing, abrasive blasting, tumbling, degreasing, a three-part de-rust/abrasive finish and blast operation, and some glass bead and plastic media paint stripping. President Robert Van Schoick engineered the expansion that tripled Toledo's volume and customer base in just three years. As part of that plan, he examined every step and product used in both facilities. As a result, many aspects of the operation changed. Conversion to all-aqueous cleaning is one notable example, as is the addition of some plastic media processing. Obtaining ISO 9000 registration, and instituting company-wide JIT (all parts are shipped in 24-48 hrs) were other important changes. One thing that has remained unchanged since the early 1980's is parts drying. Parts exit a tumbler or vibratory finisher coated with a soap and rust-inhibiting oil. Water must be quickly eliminated to avoid spotting. Residual contaminants are isolated and the rust inhibitor is evenly re-deposited. Two machines, a Rotofinish (vibratory) Spiratron and a Ransohoff tumbler/dryer, are used. The media used in both systems is Grit-O-Cobs®, a corncob product developed and manufactured by The Andersons, Maumee, Ohio. Parts are dried in the Spiratron for five to 10 min and for 30 min in the tumbler/dryer. The corncob media acts like a sponge. It pulls contaminants away from the parts, evaporating the water, and distributing the rust-inhibiting oil evenly over the surface. The soft surface of the corncob media cushions the parts against damage during processing. The corncob media also has consistent particle sizing. Mr. Van Schoick explained, "If media particle size varies, it adheres in the slots and threads, and accumulates in passageways." To complicate matters, all vegetable-based media swells when it contacts water. Thus, it is important that particle size be consistent, as with corncob media. The corncob media is manufactured from commercial ear corn as well as hybrid varieties. Milling equipment progressively separates the components by grinding, air classifying and screening. Particles are separated and sized through aspiration and screening. Seven commercial grades (and a few proprietary grades) are available, with granules ranging in size from ¼-inch to a material similar to fine powder. Applications range from drying to grit blasting. Often, corncob media is used as a blending media with other materials to add volume, extend service life and reduce costs. Toledo uses two corncob sizes, each sized to dryer specifications. Product life is estimated at 40 to 80 dryer hrs, depending on the condition of loads as they are received from stampers. Whether the application is drying or blasting, the corncob media remains virtually dust free. It is also all-natural and biodegradable; therefore it does not present an environmental problem. Notably for Toledo Deburring, the waste product is dry, so it is more manageable and less voluminous than wet waste generated by aqueous washers and other systems used to perform the same task. Using corncob media in a 150F dryer is less costly than processing without media because of the hotter temperatures and longer cycles that are needed when no media is used. It is also worth noting that there are three ways to prevent water spotting: deionized water, hand buffing or corncob media. Of these, corncob media is the most cost-effective for Toledo Deburring. Corncob media also adds luster to the parts.

The heart of the system is the gun-control unit that controls all the pneumatic and electrical functions of each gun. Modules are ergonomically positioned for ease of operation and can be added or removed quickly. The master system control modules provide electrical and pneumatic supplies for up to nine gun units and incorporate the controls for fluidized beds and gun manipulators if needed. Manual systems include a powder feed cup, fluidized bed or direct feed from the powder container. The fluidized bed is used with a 25 kg hopper or 1.25 kg hopper for short runs. The automatic powder gun incorporates a forward air line, permitting variable velocity powder emissions for additional spray pattern control without altering powder output. Powder is contained in a number of fluidized beds, fed to the gun by the V55 venturi, which uses two air lines to ensure controllable, surge-free powder delivery from low flows to 500 grams per min. The system provides smooth, uniform coverage even at powder outputs of 200 grams per min and a charge of 20 uA at 60kV, even on complex-shaped parts. Two manipulators are available with the powder system. One is a conventional type and the other is the "Swinger." This is an electrically driven manipulator designed to carry multiple spray guns performing the same or different motions. The guns may either reciprocate vertically over a short arc or swing through an arc up to a maximum angle of 90 deg. Alternate guns may be mounted in a fixed position or any combination to obtain optimum product coating performance. Source: Eurotec Finishing Systems, Florence, Kentucky.

The aircraft engine and component overhaul/repair facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, is now getting double duty from its wastewater treatment system. The system, intended only for plating rinse waters also treats concentrated wastes from departments that had previously had them hauled away as hazardous waste. Standard Aero's story is bound to be repeated many times over as plating industry executives factor in the growing roles of environmental compliance, water use, resource reuse and waste minimization in plant economics. The emphasis is on treatment technologies that can be applied to variable waste streams, plant designs that allow one waste stream to play off another during the treatment process, and other methods of making compliance pay. Designed and built by Beckart Environmental, Inc., Kenosha, Wisconsin, the wastewater treatment system went on-line simultaneously with the company's new plating department. The department primarily handles chromium, but also silver and copper plating on various aircraft components, as well as cadmium stripping. Typically, rinse waters and scrubber water containing chromium, cyanide and various acid streams are collected in two pits located below the plating line. The maintenance schedule is two to three scrubber wash downs per day using 50 gal per wash, so the water is highly concentrated. Chromium and cyanide destruction are accomplished in separate two-step processes involving adjustments in pH and chemical reactions with sodium metabisulfite and sodium hypochlorite, respectively. These reactions convert cyanide to cyanate, and chemically reduce chromium from its hexavalent to trivalent state. Secondary reactions are the oxidation of cyanate to carbon dioxide and nitrogen and the neutralization and precipitation of the trivalent chromium. A programmable logic controller (PLC) makes all chemical and engineering decisions within the treatment system, regulating critical reaction times, monitoring and adjusting pH, and metering treatment chemicals. The PLC also controls transfers from equalization tanks to treatment tanks, sedimentation clarifier and filter press. In addition to the equalization tank dedicated to the plating line, a second equalization tank is used for spent concentrates brought by drum from various parts of the plant. Cooling water from plant compressors and rinse waters from an anodizing line are used to dilute the concentrates. Spent acids from the plant are also added to help neutralize the highly alkaline solutions. The treatment scheme incorporates some waste streams in the treatment of others while minimizing overall water consumption. According to Standard Aero process engineer David Ronson, the new wastewater treatment system was selected primarily because of the technologies involved, the comprehensive design and the ability of the manufacturer to assist when wastewater treatment requirements change. Mr. Ronson noted that the system's 20 gpm sedimentation clarifier, originally designed for operation 20 pct of the time is currently operating about 60 pct of the time. Standard Aero has increased the system's filter press capacity as its needs have grown, and the company is now generating about three tons of sludge monthly. The company is considering sludge drying equipment that would further reduce disposal costs.

One afternoon, Calvin and Hobbes are walking through the woods. Calvin says, "Hey! What happened to the trees here? Who cleared out the woods? There used to be lots of animals in these woods! Now it's a mud pit!" Hobbes notes, "This sign says, `Future site of Shady Acres Condominiums.'" To which Calvin screams, "Animals can't afford condos! Where are all the animals supposed to live now that they cut down these woods to put in houses??? By golly, how would people like it if animals bulldozed a suburb and put in new trees?!? After they build new houses here, they will have to widen the roads and put up gas stations and pretty soon the whole area will just be a big strip. Eventually there won't be a nice spot left anywhere. "I wonder if you can refuse to inherit the world?" Hobbes replies, "I think if you're born, it's too late." Although humorous, I too am concerned about land development, of all kinds. Will my children and grandchildren enjoy trees, fields and streams the way I have been fortunate to experience? This is why the Brownfield movement, which aims to transform environmental trouble spots (old finishing facilities, for example) into new developments makes sense. Brownfields are abandoned, contaminated industrial sites that are redeveloped for use as new industrial sites. On January 25, 1995, the EPA issued its Brownfield Action Agenda. Administrator Browner stated, "We at EPA firmly believe that environmental cleanup is a building block to economic development, not a stumbling block. EPA's Brownfield Economic Redevelopment Initiative is an organized commitment to help communities revitalize idle or under-used industrial and commercial facilities where redevelopment is complicated by environmental contamination." Plenty of Brownfields exist in the United States. The U.S. General Accounting Office estimates that there are approximately 425,000 sites. A recent survey by the Northeastern Illinois Planning Commission noted that 18 pct of Chicago's industrial land is vacant or inactive. There are 2,000 Brownfields in the city and another 500 to 1,000 elsewhere in the six-county region. Twenty-five states now have Brownfield programs. The EPA is helping with cleanup. On May 11, 1995, the Brownfield Cleanup and Redevelopment Revolving Loan Fund Pilot Project Act of 1996, was issued. This legislation establishes a revolving loan program to provide financing for development of Brownfield sites. Also, HR 2178 provides for redevelopment of Brownfields by providing federal assistance for cleanup and other purposes. Brownfields provide a way to "recycle" previously developed land and make it usable again, and the government and EPA are willing to help. Benefits of Brownfields are that cleanup costs are reduced, purchase price is less than for undeveloped land and there will be no delays in future transactions because of past contamination. Brownfields have great potential for industry and communities both environmentally and economically . . . just ask Calvin. "People keep talking about opening more wilderness for development. We seem to understand the value of oil, timber, minerals and housing, but not the value of unspoiled beauty, wildlife, solitude and spiritual renewal." Hobbes answers, "We need to start putting prices on the priceless." And Calvin responds, "Yeah, if our woods are worth a zillion jillion bagillion, think what Alaska is worth."

For 23 years Premier Manufacturing Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio, has been plating wire products with zinc cyanide. These products are used in air conditioning units by companies such as Carrier, York and Granger. However, the company experienced problems with the zinc cyanide plating baths.It was difficult to decrease carbonates, and it was expensive to purchase and dispose of the bath. Also, the company experienced burning and other production problems. Nick Kaplafka, project engineer, was assigned to design a process to treat the carbonates as well as solve the other problems. Searching for a solution. Hull cell tests were performed on Premier's cyanide bath to determine how it could be improved. The company also had two other options: convert the bath to a non-cyanide alkaline zinc plating bath or an acidchloride plating bath. As part of his search, Mr. Kaplafka was also searching for a better way to achieve the required 0.5 mil overall thickness on the wire parts. Premier researched several non-cyanide plating baths before it chose COLZINC ACF-II alkaline non-cyanide zinc process from Columbia Chemical Corp., Brunswick, Ohio. Mr. Kaplafka decided that the alkaline non-cyanide process achievedthe company's major goal of consistent plating distribution. The switch. Prior to the switch, the company loaded a maximum of 96 pieces per bar, to minimize burning. With the new process, it has nearly doubled its load to 160 to 200 pieces per bar. In conjunction, the reject rate has decreased toless than one pct. Mr. Kaplafka explained, "We used to have 36 baskets of zinc anodes and sometimes we had to use dummy bars because of burning problems. Now, we are depleting zinc so rapidly that we use 70 baskets. We are able to place parts right next to the anodes without any high-current-density burning. Today, instead of plating four to five bars per hr, the company runs 10 bars per hr. Cycle time has decreased from 40 to 20 min. The process also allows for plating at elevated temperatures with good results. "We used to plate with a maximum current of 3,500 amps on a generator, 500 of which went to the electrocleaning tank, and we still had burning," said Mr. Kaplafka. Following the plating process conversion, the company also switched to a new alkaline cleaner. Pickle Pal™ inhibitor was added to the pickling tank to eliminate foaming and gassing when parts are lowered into it. Accordingto Mr. Kaplafka, "We used to stop putting parts in the pickling tanks near the end of the day. Now we can leave the part in overnight with no metal degradation or hydrogen buildup. We are ahead of the game in the morning." The company has also severed the generator connection between the zinc tank and the electrocleaning tank and installed a separate rectifier. A chiller maintains bath temperature at 85F. Up to 7,500 amps can be used in the zinc tank with noburning. An additional 1,500 amps are used for cleaning. To assist in quality control, a mini-lab was installed to check bath concentrations weekly. The new system eliminated the need for large, manual chemical additions. The plating had not been consistent enough to predetermine how much chemical to add, so Premier relied on the operator's visualinspection. Chemicals are metered in and chemical consumption has decreased significantly. Until two years ago, the company employed two shifts each day, six days a week. Today, employees complete the same amount of work in two eight-hour shifts, five days a week. Two years ago the company had metal bins full of unplated parts. There was no floor space in the warehouse. Now the company plates faster and always has floor space to stage ready-to-plate parts. PF TABLE I --Production Steps at Premier 1.

People are certainly talking about electronic communications, but what does it all mean to you? Well, we believe that the Internet and specifically the more commercial segment called the World Wide Web, is destined to profoundly alter the way publishers disseminate information in the future. (Not that the Internet or other forms of digital communication will take the place of the printed word. Our intent is to use electronic publishing to expand upon and enhance our print products.) The real question is, is that future now or in a few years? We're betting on sooner rather than later. That is why we are introducing our ownWeb site called GardnerWeb (http://www.gardnerweb.com opening in early October). The beauty of the World Wide Web, in addition to its democratic anarchy and infinite amounts of information, is that it is constantly changing and growing. That's the way GardnerWeb will be too. Think of it as a work in progress -- improving, reacting to your needs, growing as the technology grows. GardnerWeb will be a repository for the newest and best of what is happening in the finishing (and metalworking) industries. Breaking stories, industry events, new product information, links to other companies, even technical books will be available at GardnerWeb. We would like to take this trip on the "I-way" with you. That is why we have included opportunities for you to give us feedback as a key component of GardnerWeb. We are excited about this new method for communicating with the readers of Products Finishing. But we also recognize that this is new for us, too. We might even make a mistake or two as "newbies" (those new to the Net) are prone to do. But that's the nature of trying something new. There may be bumps (and slow modems) on this cyber-highway, but they will smooth out over time. Oh, and by the way, GardnerWeb is not our only venture into digital media. You may have already heard of the IMTS 96 CD-ROM Preview and Agenda Planner we are producing in conjunction with AMT -- The Association for Manufacturing Technologies. It's aimed at making attendees at IMTS 96 better prepared and more organized than ever before. And keep your eyes on these pages over the next few months for additional news of other exciting CD-ROM products that you won't be able to live without. As we sometimes say around here, "It's gonna be nice."

Global competition among industrial finishing operations is fierce. As companies strive to keep costs down, comply with environmental restrictions, and improve quality, they are evaluating all components of their finishing lines. Ergonomics, the human science of matching the equipment, the process, and the environment to the worker, is emerging as one of the most effective tools in the battle. In the competitive arena of plastics finishing, Service Plastics, Inc., Elk Grove Village, Illinois, discovered the benefits of making ergonomic changes to its production line when it replaced several of its traditional spray guns with an ergonomically designed gun, according to Gordon Rhoades, production manager. Service Plastics finishes television frames and cabinets in crossdraft spray booths. Parts are brought in on a conveyor, placed on holders and sprayed. The parts are then hung back on the conveyor, flashed off, and go through a short bake cycle. Much of the spraying is on horizontal surfaces. Lacquers and paints are currently supplied by IVC, Indianapolis, Indiana. (Paint suppliers are specified by Service Plastics' customers.) Service Plastics uses a water-borne suede paint (38 sec Zahn No. 2), which provides a soft, textured finish designed to cover imperfections in the plastic TV frames. The flow rate is eight oz/min. Prior to installing the ergonomic guns, the traditional HVLP spray guns required 12-15 psi atomization air to break up the lacquer. At that time, the company used 30-35 gal of paint to finish more than 1,000 units per day. In addition to the mechanical production line requirements of its finishing operations, operator fatigue had been an ongoing problem. Complaints about tired and sore shoulders, arms, wrists and upper backs, the primary muscle groups used in spray finishing, were common. Considering the potential impact of human factors on the quality and productivity of any manufacturing process, operator comfort can significantly influence to the bottom line. Spray Gun Ergonomics. Traditionally, ergonomic changes to spray guns have been represented by a small bump on the gun handle or other minor adjustment. The OMX from ITW DeVilbiss, Toledo, Ohio, represents a significant change in the technical design of a spray gun because it is the first gun to take the capabilities of the spray gun operator into consideration along with the critical requirements of spray finishing operations. The OMX gun incorporates ergonomic components in the spray gun's design. It is the lightest spray gun available, weighing only 12 oz. The grip is ergonomically designed and features a primary trigger that requires less than two lbs of pull force to actuate. The pneumatic trigger requires less than one lb of pull force to actuate. An upper trigger is designed for spraying horizontal surfaces and bottom edges while keeping the operator's wrist in a neutral position. A pattern adjustment knob requires only a quarter turn to go from full fan to round. Ergonomics and Material Savings. When the gun was first installed at Service Plastics, the company realized that ergonomic benefits were not limited to operator comfort. The company realized significant material savings almost immediately as a direct result of the ergonomic gun design and its impact on worker performance. "We have seen significant material savings over our old HVLP guns," noted Mr. Rhoades. "We're using only about 20 gal of paint per day, which is about a 33 pct savings. With these savings, we are paying for each gun in about two weeks. "Our reject rate has been reduced from seven to about 1.5 pct," he continued. "This is because the paint goes on wetter and with less pressure. Also, the fatigue factor for the painter has been reduced over the period of the day. A reduced reject rate means that operators have to repaint fewer parts, which they like." The gun air-cap pressure is approximately three to four psi. Prior to gun installation, pressure tanks were filled after three hrs of operation. With the ergonomic gun, pressure tanks remain full up to twice as long. Operator Comfort. Think of spray operators as industrial athletes whose practice sessions are a minimum of eight hours long, five to six days per week. The industrial athlete's season is 50 weeks long and it's career might span 30 years or more. In that environment, the potential impact the individual can have on the production line is significant. Realizing the importance of the gun's physical effects on the operator, the supplier contracted with the Biodynamics Laboratory at Ohio State University (OSU) to experiment and investigate the musculoskeletal risk associated with the ergonomically designed gun and a traditional metal spray gun. In this study, experienced and inexperienced male and female spray operators painted for four hours with the two different guns to quantify risks associated with wrist deviation, muscle fatigue, trigger activation and perceived discomfort. The sprayed part required 17 strokes and consisted of leading and trailing edges, plus horizontal and vertical surfaces. The gun significantly reduced radial/ulnar wrist deviation (the position for painting horizontal surfaces) compared to the traditional gun. Use of the gun resulted in up to 50 pct less fatigue in the shoulder muscles, attributed to the gun's lighter weight. As for triggering, the OSU study found that using the short, pneumatic trigger of the gun required a significantly lower level of exertion and consequently a reduction in force. All parts of the subjects' bodies experienced lower average discomfort ratings when using the gun. Significant differences between the traditional paint gun and the ergonomic gun were noted in the shoulder, upper back, arm, elbow, forearm, wrist and hand. Service Plastics realized the ergonomic impact of the gun right away in its industrial application. "Our operators have become spoiled (with the gun)," said Mr. Rhoades. "We still have a few of our old metal guns on line, and those operators often come up to me and request `the green gun'(the gun is green). They change places with someone else, use it for a while and their problems clear up." Start to Finish. Service Plastics is convinced that ergonomics is a true cost benefit. Introducing the gun to its production line has been the most revolutionary change to its finishing operation except for changes in coating technology. Mr. Rhoades points out that in today's competitive climate, anything he can do to reduce costs positions Service Plastics even better with customers. He cites the material savings resulting from the gun use and operator comfort and improved performance as essential factors in the competitive pricing equation. "I believe in the whole concept of the gun and the way it sprays. It is so much easier to spray with this gun and the results show it," said Mr. Rhoades.

Thomas Industries', Hopkinsville,Kentucky, operation recycles 12,000 gal of rinse water per shift while recovering nickel and brass. For three years the company has successfully recycled rinse waters from its nickel-brass plating facility. The company's goals are to exceed all environmental, health and safety regulations in order to support its reputation as a high-quality producer of a complete line of lighting products. These products include chandeliers, wall sconces, flush mounts, fluorescent, recess and outdoor lighting. To ensure product quality, low production costs and on-time delivery, the company elected to operate its own finishing business. The installation of new paint lines and plating facilities has been completed. The treatment of rinse waters from these facilities has been of particular importance to Thomas Industries. Of special concern was the plating operation, since the system handled heavy metals. The company chose Pollution Application Systems of Hillsborough, North Carolina, to provide the necessary equipment for recycling chemicals and rinse waters. The system reduces total rinse water need. The reduction occurs through exponential dilution (extra counterflow rinses), so water use can be reduced up to 90 pct while actually improving the rinsing process. Once water needs are reduced, plating baths are recovered using standard atmospheric evaporation. Due to the low level of water needed, the amount of evaporation is reduced, minimizing plating bath contamination. Lower water use has helped Thomas Industry reduce its energy requirements for converting water to steam and reduce impurities from incoming city water. The rinsing system did not require Thomas to re-arrange its existing tank layout. Reducing rinse water needs in its cleaning and acid dip sections helped Thomas minimize capital expenditures and conserve floor space. The electrocoagulation technology allows the company to remove an additional 90 pct of heavy metals after conventional solids removal. This brings the purity of the recovered water to parts per 10 million, compared to parts per million for conventional end-of-pipe treatment. The recovered water is reused in the rinse tank. It is low in all metals, including calcium, magnesium and iron. The water is also free of algae and bacteria. The plating process at Thomas Industries is as follows: Buffing compound removal, hot, two stations Rinse Soak Cleaner, hot, two stations Electrocleaner, hot Rinse, two stations Acid clean Rinse, two stations Nickel plate, eight stations, atmospheric evaporation 140F Transfer tanks with spray rinse Rinse, three stations Brass strike (CN) Brass plate (CN), three stations, Atmospheric evaporator 105F Auxiliary heated tank for evaporation Rinse, six stations, all counterflow to auxiliary tank Oxidizer (antique finish) Rinse, three station counterflow DI rinse, spot prevention DI rinse, hot Dryer, two station Because of the high recovery of nickel and brass, solid waste volume, after dewatering in a plate-and-frame filter press, has been reduced by 90 pct. The water removed from the sludge is returned to the electrocoagulation system. Even though Thomas Industries uses cyanide plating solutions in the brass plating tanks, the return of all rinse water limits the need for cyanide destruction. The low volume of evaporation in the atmospheric evaporator, resulting from the exponential dilution concept, minimizes buildup of carbonate in the brass tank. Now that the company has good, cost-effective control of its plating operation, the next step is to recover and recycle rinse water from its parts washer and paint pretreatment line. If this is successful, periodic disposal of alkaline cleaners, spent acids and filtration backwash from brass and nickel tanks will be all that is left to contend with. Thomas Industries has attacked the problem of pollution control in a systematic manner. The equipment installed on the plating machine required approximately three weeks to install and another month of tweaking and adjustment to bring it to its present performance.

He was our Ann Landers. A lot of platers benefited not only from his replies to their own queries, but from reading his advice to others. Problems that occur in one plating shop are likely to bedevil others as well. So if you don't have the problem today you may have it tomorrow. Larry's replies were based largely on experience. He spent his early post-college years in rubber boots on a plating line, solving his own problems. Later he worked for suppliers of proprietary chemicals in "technical service," which translates to "OK, I bought your stuff and now I'm getting rejects, so DO SOMETHING." Larry did something. But unlike a lot of us, he had a memory chip in his head that contained information about what he had done and why it had worked or not worked. I've talked to readers who don't do plating, but they read the column. They just like to read his advice to the people who have tried everything and nothing has worked. After all, if the solution for the problem were obvious, the plater wouldn't write. Eventually Larry became the technical director of a plating-supply company. There he concocted chemicals that produced more good parts than bad, making the lives of technical service persons less arduous. And pre-solving some problems for many platers. In the years since he retired from the world of eight-hour days with beakers and flasks nearby, he has written the Plating Clinic column. Taught courses. Wrote books. Was the editor of the Electroplating Engineering Handbook. And did some consulting for people who wanted to pay for a private session with the wizard. Amazingly he still had time for fishing, electronics tinkering, grandchildren (his seven children have been increasing the Durney clan), and bouncing back and forth between a cottage in Cape Cod and his home in New Jersey. Now he's decided to take more time for those personal pursuits. So regretfully he's written his last response to a PF reader. It has been a pleasure to work with Larry. He was prompt. He explained patiently why chemicals do what they do and why sometimes plating is still an art as well as a science. He showed his sense of humor in answering serious questions. Best of all, when we surveyed readers and asked what they liked about Products Finishing, "Plating Clinic" always was among the top scores. As a former editor of PF, that's the greatest compliment I can give to a columnist. We wish all the best for Larry and his family in the coming years. Jerry Poll.

By Juergen Heiler Thyssen Umformtechnik Bielefeld, Germany In 1992, Thyssen Umformtechnik installed a batch-type electrocoat line suitable for coating a variety of parts up to 39 ft long. Parts include fabricated sheet parts such as doors or panels for cabs; truck chassis parts up to 39 ft; subassemblies for cars and trucks; and axle components for cars comprising up to 80 individual parts. The total capital spent on this coating line amounted to around 35 million German marks. Application process. The coating process is comprised of 13 tanks, 39 by eight by eight ft, with volumes ranging from 300 to 383 cu ft. A five-unit conveyor system with a useful load of five metric tons carries the workpieces through the installation. Parts are then baked at a minimum metal temperature of 350F in a 333 ft long oven. Cycle time is seven and a half min, and the complete processing time in the electrocoat line is three and a half hrs. Next to this line, Thyssen installed a separate wastewater treatment plant to treat wastewater generated by the process. Planning the conversion. When the installation came on line, Thyssen used a black, leaded electrocoat product supplied by BASF (FT82-9636). This two-component system matched the automotive industry's requirements at that time. An order for coating replacement parts resulted in a change of the requirements. For safety and environmental reasons, an unleaded electrocoat product was now required. In cooperation with BASF, plans were made to replace the leaded electrocoat system, with consideration given to the following: For environmental and cost reasons, the old product was not discarded. Technological properties such as corrosion protection could not be adversely affected. The coating technology could not be changed (suitable for low-build/high-build application). No plant design changes because of the added cost. We worked out a process for converting the tank that consisted of gradually adding the unleaded product to the leaded product. The effect of the lead on the anti-corrosive properties was compensated for by changing the binders used. Advanced testing. Before any conversion was actually made, several concerns needed to be addressed. The anti-corrosive properties of the individual coatings as well as mixtures had to be guaranteed. We also wanted customer approval for panels/parts. System stability had to be guaranteed at various stages of mixing, so tests were carried out on the products at various stages of mixing. The tests carried out by Thyssen and BASF Corp. gave the following results. No differences on sample panels for corrosion testing: 10 cycles corrosion test according to VDA 621-415 30 cycles gravel/corrosion test according to P_VW 1210 240 hrs salt spray test according to DIN 50021 No reduction in corrosion protection in transitional stages No instability in the bath during transitional stages. Conversion. Product conversion started when the new unleaded pigment paste was added for the first time on September 30, 1992. The duration of the conversion depended on bath turnover. Throughout the conversion phase, we observed no decline in quality or any other problems. In agreement with our customer, 0.15 pct lead was defined as the threshold value marking unleaded material. Once this value was reached, our customer approved the coating. Presently, the lead concentration is in the ppm range. In close cooperation with our supplier and a variety of OEM customers, we successfully dealt with this challenge without compromising quality. Prospects. Heavy metals are damaging to the environment, and their use entails expensive measures such as wastewater treatment and disposal. While these processes can be controlled, complete elimination of heavy metals from as many products as possible is a better option. Enhanced environmental awareness is clearly supported by customers. The conversion to an unleaded electrocoat system was therefore the first step towards an environmentally friendly coating process. The next steps consisted of replacing chrome-based passivation with a chromate-free product and changing the phosphate system from a nitrite-accelerated product to one containing an internal accelerator. These actions will make it much easier to treat the wastewater and dispose of any production residues. This is a prerequisite for setting up a closed water recirculation system. At present, we recirculate approximately 90 pct of the water in our electrocoat plant. The Thyssen Group comprises three operating divisions: Steel (Thyssen Stahl AG); Trade and Services (Thyssen Handelsunion); and Capital Goods and Manufacturing (Thyssen Industrie AG/ Budd Company). Within Thyssen Industrie AG, the business unit Thyssen Umformtechnik (Metal Forming) operates from several production sites. With some 1,300 employees, the Brackwede site achieves an annual turnover of 300 million German marks.

Colorful playground equipment dots the center of New York's Central Park. A bright, whimsical play area is a favorite attraction. Vivid play areas brighten favorite restaurants nationwide. All of these benefit from the quality manufacturing that has made Landscape Structures, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, an industry leader. Landscape Structures is one of America's largest and best-known manufacturers of outdoor recreational equipment. It is also a leading industry exporter. The reason, according to Tom Wetter, manufacturing engineer, is consistent quality. "It is our number one priority, and has been for the quarter century we have been in business." It would be difficult to name a product category where the demands are more varied or extreme. Playground equipment, far from being child's play, must be durable. It must maintain a bright, pleasing appearance with virtually no maintenance, despite continuous stress and abuse. It must perform despite daily UV exposure and fluctuating temperatures. Because customers range from parks to schools, needs and budgets differ. Each system is custom designed. "In this way," said Mr. Wetter, "we are very much a job shop. We are also governed by a comprehensive Management Resource Planning system that controls production schedules and deliveries." Depending on the size and site, as well as customer preference, equipment is fabricated from aluminum, steel or one of several plastics: Lexan polycarbonate, or high- or low-density polyethylene. Finishing, however, is the same, whatever base material is used. "In 1995," Mr. Wetter explained, "we decided to minimize outsourcing. One of the key areas we wanted to bring in-house was finishing. We investigated and tested out numerous alternatives. What met our requirement was a 0.032 to 0.125 inch PVC coating followed by a single-stage salt cure. Of all the options we considered, this was the only combination of finish and cure method that could deliver the tensile strength, UV resistance and other product characteristics we wanted." During its investigation, Landscape Structures and its three-man decision team were all newcomers to salt processing technology. "Interestingly," said Mr. Wetter, "each of us approached the question from a different vantage point. The owner's was financial and long term. Mine, as an engineer, was toward material performance. The foreman was most concerned with the predictability of the process, the maintenance it would require and waste treatment that might be needed. Precision Quincy, a manufacturer of finishing systems and specialty ovens in Woodstock, Illinois, was selected to engineer and build the coating application system. The PVC curing system was subcontracted by Precision Quincy to Ajax Electric Co., Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. Mr. Wetter designed/engineered a dip-application system with a tank capacity of 2,200 gal. Parts originating from one of the several in-house production lines, as well as a few remaining outsource suppliers, are loaded on flexible fixture carriers. Carriers accommodate one to 100 parts, depending on size and shape. Power-and-free conveyers move the carriers to mild-steel tanks where parts are immersed in type two PVC for one to five min. After a brief air set, parts are advanced in-line to the "Next Generation" salt furnace. Fully programmable, with a 35,000 lb capacity, the electric-powered furnace cures the PVC in a single-stage using Parcure 305, a nitrate/nitrite salt developed for this purpose by Heatbath/Park Metallurgical, Springfield, Massachusetts. Furnace dwell time is two to four min at 350F. While PVC is heat-sensitive, parts requiring just two min of cure can be processed in the same load with those requiring four min, without compromising the finish quality. "The heat sink qualities of the salt bath and the precision controls we have on furnace temperature make this possible," said Mr. Wetter. Multiple colors of PVC can also be processed simultaneously. The salt chemistry is chemically neutral to the nascent PVC. The cure range temperature of 380F is below any breakdown thresholds for PVC. Since the PVC is not chemically or thermally attacked, its viscosity is enough to hold it in place until crosslinking is complete. This results in a fast, uniform and effective cure. After curing parts go through a one-stage water wash with mild agitation. The salinity must be monitored and controlled in this tank to provide efficient washing. Waste generation was a major factor in Landscape Structure's decision. "It is essentially a non-issue with this curing method," according to Mr. Wetter. "We have done environmental studies and determined and documented that there are no air emissions to treat. Unlike convection, the submerged cure produces no smoke or other regulated emissions. The system allows us to meet both EPA and OSHA air standards without any add-on devices." The news regarding solid waste is equally good. "There really is not any of that either," said Mr. Wetter. "We use an Econosal recycling system from Ajax." This system reclaims salts from all process stages and eliminates sewer discharge. "We get complete salt reclamation," said Mr. Wetter. "There is no wasted material. We add a small amount of salt periodically to regenerate, but dragout is virtually nil." Before making its equipment decisions, Landscape Structures modeled utility costs for the salt furnace against those for appropriately sized infrared and convection ovens. "Our example, which was based on the level at which we are now processing (one carrier every six min, 40 hrs per week) showed the utility costs would have been in the neighborhood of 50 pct higher if we had chosen convection curing," said Mr. Wetter. "And this is despite the fact that the salt bath is maintained at temperature when not in use." Landscape Structures has operated its new system for more than a year. The company posted record earnings in 1995, and forecasts an eight to 10 pct increase in fiscal 1996. New avenues are opening too. "We have just completed our first two OEM projects," noted Mr. Wetter. "And there are two more substantial programs on the CAD system. "We take play seriously," said Mr. Wetter. "And believe we have the equipment and the manufacturing technologies to keep Landscape Structures on top."

It was not terribly long ago that quality at most companies was equated with any product that passed quality control inspection. The Total Quality Management (TQM) revolution, however, has changed all that. Today, quality is defined as excellence in the outcome of an activity and the process used to generate the outcome. It is measured more by customer satisfaction levels than by the approval of internal inspectors. Since customer expectations tend to rise over time, TQM challenges businesses constantly and diligently to raise their standards of excellence, hence the term "continuous improvement." The TQM focus also recognizes that manufacturers working alone cannot be assured of pleasing their customers, since suppliers and resellers are part of the customer chain. TQM challenges businesses to develop relationships where parties cooperate to improve process and product quality. That is exactly what The William L. Bonnell Company, one of the world's largest independent aluminum extruders, has done by working closely with its coating partner, The Sherwin-Williams Company. High capacity. From manufacturing facilities in Carthage, Tennessee, Kentland, Indiana, and Newnan, Georgia, the company produces aluminum extrusions ranging from heavy structural shapes used for casting concrete and requiring little or no finish, to picture frame parts that require sophisticated finishing techniques. Total production capacity for the three plants exceeds 140 million lbs. Of the three facilities, the Newnan plant has the largest production capacity. Two buildings cover more than 500,000 sq ft and employ 750 people. A complete cast house blends aluminum ingots and scrap into alloys specified by customers for the specialty market. Sales are primarily to fabricators who produce bath and shower enclosures, bicycle rims, air-flow equipment, furniture and automotive trim. Implementing TQM. Bonnell began implementing a TQM approach across all operations at the Newnan plant in 1992. Since that time, several dozen Process Improvement Teams (PITS) have been formed to develop and implement quality-enhancing ideas. The TQM program has enabled the company to achieve an on-time delivery rate 20 pct above the industry standard. This is one important measure of quality in the aluminum extrusion industry. The company's continuous improvement strategy did not allow it to stop there. Ongoing scrutiny of processes revealed that the on-time delivery rate could be further improved by increasing finishing line productivity. Teaming up. Bonnell's finishing department in Newnan operates under the guidance of plant manager Don Moore and paint factory coordinator Don Bowles. The department, however, has been managed since 1994 by an employee-directed work team responsible for scheduling, packaging and ordering materials, including coating colors. The finishing system, manufactured by Young and Bertke, Cincinnati, Ohio, has the capability to coat extrusions as long as 24 ft. Parts hang every three to 12 inches on a 1,240-ft conveyor that travels 12 to 19 fpm. After processing through the five-stage chrome phosphate pretreatment, parts dry in a 40-ft oven at 250F. Pretreatment chemicals are supplied by Bulk Chemical, Mohrsville, Pennsylvania. Finishes are applied in two, 30-ft high, eight-ft diameter silo-type Omega loop paint booths using ITW Ransburg turbo reciprocating disks. Coated parts bake at 360F for 10 min before they are packaged and shipped. Prior to 1995, six suppliers provided coatings to Bonnell's Newnan plant. "If you are buying the same product from six companies, you are probably not a great customer for any supplier," said Andy Massey, Newnan plant purchasing manager. The concept of partnering advocated by the TQM approach encouraged the company to consider a single-source supplier. "One supplier has the opportunity to learn your business, respond to your needs, and help you improve your processes," Mr. Massey said. A Bonnell Process Improvement Team (PIT) set about developing a list of criteria for a single source supplier/partner. These quality criteria included: Provision of a high-quality, high-solids polyester baking enamel that resists drips, runs, sags and blisters. Meets federal and state VOC guidelines. Achieves gloss specifications of plus or minus five units. Is available in a ready-to-use formula. Technical analysis and support for improving finishing line efficiency. Customer service programs that provide Bonnell with information on regulatory changes, new equipment developments and updates on coatings technology. Local warehousing of inventory and next day delivery on stocked items. Local technical service for immediate response and emergency technical response service within 24 hrs. Training programs to teach employees application techniques for coatings and equipment. The ability to process special color orders and sample color chip matches within five days. The ability to match colors regardless of shape, size, texture or composition of part. Participation in Bonnell's improvement program. The selection process was comprised of two parts: on-line testing of various coating systems, and evaluation of supplier programs. Sherwin-Williams was the supplier selected. The company's PermaClad® 2400 high-solids polyester baking enamel met or exceeded the performance requirements as well as other criteria. "In addition to meeting our coating and service needs, Sherwin-Williams is ISO-9000 certified at all its plants and laboratories," Mr. Moore said. "This was another indication that they would understand and be an active participant in our quality program." The Bonnell PIT outlined eight measurements for determining the effectiveness of the relationship. "Within the first 60 days we were able to achieve five of our eight objectives," Mr. Bowles said. "Scrap, repaint, and production lead times were reduced. Production run-time increased, while inventories were reduced. We are even receiving quick turnaround on colors. All of these factors have resulted in productivity gains." Partnering in action. Representatives from the supplier's Design Engineering Group (DEG) visited Bonnell's Newnan plant to evaluate the operation. Closely reviewed were material handling, pretreatment/dry off, application room, delivery system, mixing room, application equipment, and bake oven. "The result of the visit was a comprehensive report listing 45 suggestions for improving our operation," Mr. Moore said. In the report, both maintenance issues and a need to re-engineer portions of the process were addressed. Recommendations covered topics ranging from parts hanging procedures to paint mix room temperature. For example, one suggestion regarding parts hanging was that the load bar should have inverted teardrop-shaped holes rather than round ones. This reduces rotation of the hanger rod. Another suggestion was more consistent spacing between the load bars. In the paint mix room, it was recommended that pump control panels be moved to the wall closest to the paint application area, and that a trench be installed for circulation tubing. These changes would reduce the quantity of paint in the circulation system and facilitate cleaning the loop during color changes. "Each change we make will contribute in a small way to improving the overall operation," Mr. Moore said. "Continued effort will keep the system operating properly." Bonnell also has taken advantage of the services of the supplier's Color and Design Marketing Group. The team of color experts is familiar with trends and technology in a wide variety of markets. It specializes in providing coating users with a fresh and objective approach to their color requirements. For Bonnell, the group provided an analysis of the standard colors offered by the company and made suggestions for updating and enhancing the color palette so that it would appeal to a broader range of customers. In addition to offering standard colors, Bonnell also works with its supplier to provide custom colors per customer specification.

In order to remain competitive and increase profits, Plating Technology decided to reduce labor, scrap and material use at its two Ohio facilities; one in Columbus and the other in Dayton. The facilities plate steel parts that require enhanced corrosion protection. It also performs aluminum anodizing and hard coating. The company's first step was a large investment in new finishing methods and processes that offered improved products and helped it comply with a number of regulatory requirements. Fortunately, this investment led to customer growth. The company continues to grow with its customer base. Because it has two plants with similar finishing capabilities, it has a great deal of flexibility in meeting quality and delivery requirements. The two facilities provide acid and alkaline zinc plating, acid zinc-cobalt, acid tin-zinc, nickel, electroless nickel, tin, alkaline zinc nickel as well as the aluminum finishes mentioned previously. Plating is done for a variety of industries, including automotive, glass, fastener, food service, construction, hardware, electrical and appliance manufacturers. Henry Berger, director of engineering, summarized the company's philosophy, "Plating Technology has a reputation for providing quality electroplated and anodized products, along with timely delivery to its customers. All of the products and processes are strictly controlled and can be audited. We take a proactive position in keeping up-to-date with the latest improvements in the industry and formally educating customers to the advantages of the most recently developed technologies." All plating baths have amp/hr meters and chemical feed pumps for automatic chemical additions. The baths are chemically analyzed on a timed schedule, with all data, including the amount added by the feed pump, entered into a computer for statistical analysis. Similarly, quality control test instruments have helped the company save on rework and scrap. Quality control test instruments were purchased for each of the facilities. Each has two XRX x-ray fluorescence coating/plating thickness measuring systems from CMI International. Lab personnel use them, but the systems are primarily used by machine operators during production. The thickness testing systems print out statistical data that travel with the parts through the production process. Lab personnel use salt spray testing for ASTM B 117 corrosion tests. About 50 pct of the company's customers request this. The completely equipped laboratory has the capability for titration, Hull cell testing, pilot lines to duplicate plating processes and an atomic absorption spectrophotometer for checking the alloy content of several mixed metal co-deposits. As a service to its fastener customers, Plating Technology performs hydrogen embrittlement testing. The labs are also General Motors GP-10 certified. The Dayton facility also has three EMX eddy current/magnetic induction coating thickness test instruments. The Columbus facility has one. These instruments are positioned on the manufacturing floor, central to machine operators. They also produce data that travel with the parts through production. The x-ray units provide thickness and alloy analysis of zinc-nickel co-deposits over the entire part, even areas that would seem to be inaccessible. The testing instruments have helped cut down on scrap and rework at Plating Technology. This, in addition to new plating technologies and attention to detail, has helped increase the customer base while lowering overall costs by 25 pct.

By Don McCluckieRichards-Wilcox, Inc. Aurora, Illinois Automating material handling is one of the mostimportant steps in planning a finishing operation. The right choice adds efficiency, adaptability and dependability, whether you are finishing household appliances, automotive parts, office products or aircraft components. Where to begin. Any good plan begins by determining your material-handling objectives. An efficient conveyor system provides for repeatability and precision. It allows for a continuous flow of operations. It improves overall product quality and lowers costs. Also, the right system provides flexibility and versatility to grow with plant needs. Power-and-free conveyor systems meet these objectives. However, several types of overhead conveyors are also available, including manual monorail and continuous power conveyors. Conveyor types. Manual monorail conveyors consist of a steel channel from which a trolley is hung. To spread the weight of the load over the track, a loadbar and additional trolleys are used as needed. This type of conveyor is best suited for low-volume applications when plant personnel are available to manually move the load. In a continuous power system, a chain is pulled by an electrical drive mechanism with the product attached directly to the chain. Continuous power conveyors work well in applications where a large volume of parts goes through identical processes. One drawback is that the system must be designed for the slowest process in the production loop. For situations with variations in work flow, power-and-free conveyors offer the most flexibility. A power-and-free system combines the powered rail of a continuous power line with non-powered (free) rail that carries the weight of the products. Since the two can run independently, products are moved by the interface between the rails. The powered chain pushes the trolley on the free rail by means of a pusher dog. The flexibility of a power-and-free conveyor system allows tracks to be arranged to carry product at different rates through various operations. This allows finishing equipment to be sized for optimum efficiency. Product carriers can be stopped in designated areas for loading, assembly or inspection; switched to other powered loops or manual spurs; or accumulated for meeting, sequencing or work-in-process storage. In finishing operations, power-and-free allows for optimum throughput through ovens and spray booths. Long loads can be conveyed parallel to the main line, then turned for storage or sorting. To minimize booth size or allow for turning clearances, loads may be racked horizontally and travel through a paint booth parallel to the conveyor, then travel perpendicular while drying in the oven and moving through the rest of the system. Products can also follow multiple routes, so a variety of parts requiring different processes can be sent through the same system. This feature is important when a large number of parts are finished using combinations of stripping, pretreating, priming and finishing. These conveyors can be linked to Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) systems for routing and monitoring throughout the entire manufacturing process. Designing the system. Once you have identified a power-and-free conveyor as the most practical means of material handling for your application, evaluate the characteristics of your operation. An efficient conveyor system design depends on a thorough consideration of your finishing processes. What products will be carried? Consider your products before designing your conveyor. What types of components are involved? How much does each weigh? What are the dimensions? How much do components vary in size and shape? Can multiple parts be carried? Will loading and unloading be manual or automatic? The answers will help you specify the appropriate loadbars, attachments and carriers for the system. Projecting production rates. The rate of production has a tremendous impact on system design. A power-and-free conveyor system is engineered to accommodate the different speeds needed for various functions. You need to calculate carrier rates, determine chain-dog spacing and conveyor speed for the overall production line. Buffer storage space can also be incorporated into a system. For example, products can be sent into storage areas to await color or process changes. Buffer storage requires minimal handling by plant employees. Power-and-free systems can be arranged with storage located overhead on a second tier of conveyor lines, efficiently using otherwise wasted space above the production floor. When production rates differ between finishing processes or functions, buffer storage provides an efficient way to handle materials. Components may move through anodizing much more quickly than curing and drying. Buffer storage takes up the slack without reducing system efficiency. Finishing processes. Next, consider the processes involved in your finishing operations. What ovens, spray booths, degreasers and washers are involved? Depending on the type, variety and combination of paints, special considerations may be necessary. In one operation, for example, the finishing operation handles more than 160,000 components with 1,100 different combinations of paints, primers and coatings. Power-and-free systems are quite adept at handling multiple functions. Some components may require a prime coat only, with the final coat applied to the assembled product. Other components may require multiple coats of paint. With a power-and-free system, both groups can be placed on the same conveyor. Carriers will be identified electronically, then routed through different processes. Procedures can even be repeated, such as applying multiple coats of paint. At the end of the line, components accumulate for assembly. Plant layout. To design the most workable conveyor system, evaluate the layout of the plant carefully. Start with a plant layout that shows the location of building columns, walls, machines, aisles and service areas that the conveyor must negotiate. Changes in elevation and direction are important to consider. Power-and-free conveyors are adaptable to most situations, even when retrofitted into plants with multiple levels. Conveyors with enclosed tracks maneuver multiple turns and steep inclines better than I-beam conveyors. Enclosed track systems also require less headroom, fitting into tight spaces effectively. Once you have decided that a power-and-free conveyor is right for your finishing application, consult a manufacturer to help you design the system and select the proper components for your specific operation. Used successfully in most industrial applications, power-and-free conveyors are noted for their reliable operation in paint booths, oily atmospheres and ovens. The right material handling system reduces finishing time, increases throughput and saves labor costs. Power-and-free conveyor systems are relatively simple, yet adaptable and flexible enough to adapt to changes in procedures and production volume.

By Beverly A. Graves Editor The Midwest tends to be conservative, as does one of its largest cities,St.Louis, Missouri. Fin-Clair Corporation, St. Louis, fits right in. "We are notacompany that volunteers to be the 'guinea pig' for new products," statedGeneralManager Pat Gleason. However, that does not mean that the company is notwillingto try new processes or improve its products. Fin-Clair is one of a growing number of platers that also does powdercoating.It also provides zinc, nickel-chromium and duplex nickel-chromiumplating at twofacilities. The company's Knoxville, Tennessee facility, which runsnickel-chromium on two automated hoist lines, had been testing variousbright-nickel plating systems. "We run what should be the perfect system,sincewe run at higher-than-normal current densities; 50 to 60 asf," noted Mr.Gleason. The Knoxville facility is smaller than the facility in St. Louis. It platesseat belt assemblies, nearly 40 million a year. It was here that Fin-Clairtestedfour bright nickel PPS and index-based plating baths. PPS-type systemsprovidegood leveling and extremely bright deposits at various depositthicknesses. Indexbaths tend to provide less leveling but improved low-current-densityperformanceand consistent physical properties. Each one started out workingperfectly, buteventually ran into problems. "I anticipated the problems," Mr. Gleasonstated."We run a total reclaim on the bath. Rinses flow right back into the tank.Thereis no evaporation or ion exchange, and we do not have any dragout. Also,PPS-based brightener systems commonly have problems with buildup ofdegradationproducts." Each system the company tried would also suffer from a buildup ofinorganicproducts, such as chloride. The plating became irregular. "It wasdisappointing," noted Mr. Gleason. "We really liked the brightness andductilityof the PPS bath, but we kept having problems with inconsistentplating." The principal ingredient of a PPS solution is a type of pyridinederivative.The solution may contain a small amount of pyridine, but this is incidentaltothe performance of the process. PPS solutions provide excellent levelingandbrightness in high and intermediate current densities. The deposits alsohaveexcellent ductility and chromium receptivity. However, as PPS baths age, performance deteriorates and extra additivesarerequired to maintain high leveling. Buildup of degradation products causesa lossof ductility and an overall reduction of leveling and brightness. Thebreakdownproducts are difficult to remove and may render the system inoperable. Soon Mr. Gleason came across still another bright nickel plating system,however, this system was a non-PPS, non-index system that was lowchloride. TheEnthone-OMI Ultra-Lite 2000 bright nickel plating system was installed intheduplex nickel/chromium hoist line in the St. Louis facility and run forseveralmonths. Pleased with the results, the company installed the process in oneof itsKnoxville, Tennessee, plating lines. Because of the excellent performance,theprocess was installed on the second line in Knoxville. The two main reasons for the conversion were the deposit's low stressandexcellent ductility. One of Fin-Clair's customers manufactureswheelchairs and isquite particular about its parts. The company puts a 180-deg bend on partsafterplating and cannot afford to have any nickel peel or crack. "You can bendthesepieces until they break and nothing happens; no cracking or chipping,"stated Mr.Gleason. "The deposit is like molten butter." The process is designed for an air-agitated rack plating operation. Thedeposits have excellent chromium receptivity and low internal stress. Thesystemalso plates bright in low-current-density areas. This makes it ideal forplatingcomplex-shaped parts such as some of the wheelchair pieces and seat beltassemblies Fin-Clair finishes. The H-shaped plating line at the St. Louis facility is used to rack platebothchloride zinc and bright nickel. The same soak, electrocleaners and rinsesareused on parts that will be zinc or nickel plated. Once cleaning is complete,parts enter a transfer tank where a hoist takes the rack of parts throughzinc ornickel plating. Zinc and nickel are never run at the same time to avoidcontamination. The duplex bright nickel line has four semi-bright nickel stations andthreebright nickel stations and one trivalent chromium tank. Rinses before andafterthe nickel and chromium plating tanks are DI water, generated fromwastewatertreatment. Other rinses are fresh water. Exit sprays are used on most oftherinses to reduce dragout. After the final DI rinse, parts are dried using aforced hot-air dryer. The plating bath is easy to maintain, according to Mr. Gleason. Themaintenanceadditive works in conjunction with the carrier to provide a uniform brightdeposit. It is best controlled by direct observation of the work. Tankcontrolsregulate temperature and pH. Brightener is automatically added to thebath. Thecarrier promotes the overall uniformity of the deposit as well asimprovingductility and reducing internal stress. "The only items we add above and beyond the maintenance and thecarrier is thewetting agent, all of which are based on analysis," said Mr. Gleason. "Atfirstwe were using quite a bit of carrier, but the supplier added some of theactiveingredient to the maintenance brightener, so now we add minor doses." Thewettingagent lowers the surface tension and provides limited detergent action inthenickel solution for pit-free deposits. Another reason for the switch to the non-PPS, non-indexing nickelsystem wasthat there was no contaminant buildup. This allowed Fin-Clair to"close-the-loop." Rinses go to a holding tank in the waste treatment areaand arethen run through a vacuum distillation unit designed and built by Fin-Clair.Allequipment at Fin-Clair was designed from the ground up by companypresident andowner, Robert Mueller. The nickel concentrate is pumped from the bottom of the unit and thenthroughheavy carbon filtration. It is then available to the supervisors when theyneedto make additions to the plating tank. The distilled water is used in therinses.The last time Fin-Clair sent anything to landfill was in 1985 when itlandfilledless than 800 lb. Although conservative, Fin-Clair does not lag behind. When it comes totryingpromising new products or implementing common-sense strategies fordealing withpollution prevention, it is on the leading edge.

Large electroplating companies have enough disposal problems without having to worry about metal contaminants in their effluent. This was the problem one of the industry's largest electroplaters faced, because it had 0.51.0 ppm complexed copper in its discharge. Occasionally, this additional copper, the result of cyanide treatment, put the Midwest company near the allowed 1.7 ppm limit. After various removal methods did not help, the company contacted ATA Technologies of Cleveland, Ohio, which employed its Aqua-Fix Technology to remove the copper. The process is a proprietary technology formulated to reduce copper, lead, zinc, mercury and other heavy metals found in aqueous waste streams to nondetectable levels. Delivered as highly porous granules, the process helped the company meet its stringent discharge standards by removing contaminants in their most difficult form, dissolved/ionic. The process combined adsorption, absorption, ion exchange and chemical bonding to capture and hold the contaminants until the granules were ready for regeneration. The process can be chemically customized to treat specific contaminant streams. The Midwest electroplater set up a pilot system. The unit was placed after the gravity filtration units. Within a short time, copper was successfully removed without high capital or operating costs. The average copper concentration in the wastewater was 1.5 ppm. However, the plater desired a consistent discharge of less than 1 ppm. The system helped the plater achieve a consistent effluent of 0.6 ppm average, often with individual readings of 0.4 ppm or less. The pilot program included support services. The supplier routinely inspected the electroplater's unit and conducted regeneration services as needed. Sampling and testing services were available to determine the current effectiveness of the process. Additionally, should the plater's limits or requirements change, the system can be upgraded. Addon modules are also available to upgrade existing treatment systems for optimum efficiency or to meet new compliance standards.

What Masking Devices Do I Use? Types of masking materials to use in plating baths, curing ovens and more... By John Glebas Shaw Aero Development, Inc. Naples, Florida Ever since I tried to paint bothsides of some shelves at the same time, I have never really enjoyed painting. I needed some way to hold the painted object up so I could paint both sides. Painters, platers and processors face this problem every day. One-pass all-side coating is the most efficient process, but cannot be accomplished all the time because of the unusual shapes of objects. For most applications, the product can be hung from racks, placed in trays or loaded on a conveyor. However, when painting spheres, cylinders, tubes and other unusual shapes, sometimes a more singular solution is required. Expanding a plug into the hole can be the trick that solves two problems. The first and most obvious is that the plug seals the hole, preventing the coating from entering the item and saving coating material. The second feature is that a properly designed plug can be used to hold the coated object from hooks or hangers. Plating applications face similar problems since there are usually some access or drain holes that must be sealed. To obtain the proper finish, all plugs and seals need to be compatible with the coating materials. This means the sealing device cannot leach any material into the bath. All seals meant for reuse cannot be destroyed by the process, and, therefore, must be compatible with the temperature and bath. For painting and coating applications, most reusable sealing devices withstand any commercial paint or powder. However the drying and curing processes require that the rubber sealing portion withstand temperatures in excess of 400°F. In addition, for applications where the seals will be cleaned, it is important that the seal resist acidic cleaners. For plating applications, the rubber seal needs to be compatible with the applied bath material. Table I presents selections for designing a sealing device compatible with your process. Table II provides guides that are general recommendations and should be tested prior to starting production. All processes should be tested using disposable samples. The preferred hardware for sealing devices is stainless steel. However, small savings can be realized using zinc-plated steel. After selecting the proper material, the requirements for a closure mechanism need to be addressed. For pressure seals, a hex nut or handle should be used to ensure adequate closing pressure is applied. For repetitive processes, a snap-action cam can be used to allow quick insertion and removal. The variety of closure styles is unlimited and usually designed right on the plant floor. When selecting a sealing device, all parameters must be reviewed prior to selecting the material. The best material may not be discovered until after several trials. For example, while silicone is an excellent high-temperature material if used in a threaded hole, it may split frequently. By examining the sealing materials beforehand, one can avoid calamities on the production line.

By Joseph Subda DuPont Electrocoating Technical Group Mt. Clemens, Michigan In the electrocoat process, quality is everything. A first-class electrocoat finish is difficult to obtain unless you know precisely what is happening inside the electrocoating tank. Electrocoat application depends on numerous factors: voltage, current, time, temperature and chemistry. Chemically, there is an abundance of knowledge on what happens during the electrocoating process. The knowledge base for what happens to temperature, voltage and current is less abundant. Traditionally, electrocoat tank monitoring devices measure the total output of voltage and current at the rectifier/anode and the average temperature of the electrocoat bath. These measurements reveal little about what is happening at specific areas of parts in the tank. Parts, such as automobiles, are comprised of complex metal shapes. When these vehicles are processed through an electrocoat tank, voltage, current and temperature vary from point to point. In addition, voltage, current and temperature vary for a given area as the vehicle processes through the tank. Optimizing system performance requires an understanding of what is happening at specific areas of the vehicle as it passes through an electrocoat tank. Traditional monitoring devices do not provide the data needed to obtain such an understanding. In the past, improvements to the system were done using trial and error. Gaining insight into what actually happens in an electrocoat tank requires an instrument that measures and records voltage, current and temperature on specific areas of a vehicle during the electrocoating process. In the spring of 1994, work on such an instrument began. In the winter of 1994, a submersible data acquisition unit was born. The device measures voltage and current at specific points during electrocoating. Meet the Sub. The instrument can determine the condition of an anolyte cell, estimate film build and determine the electric field produced by an anolyte cell. In addition, data gathered are used to optimize the anolyte cell configuration and determine the behavioral characteristics of electrocoat in a production tank. The instrument consists of an electronic recorder, circuit board, leak proof container, probes and grounding wires. Its nickname, "The Sub," is derived from the shape of the leakproof container. Using magnets, probes are attached to various points on the parts. They sense the amount of voltage or current at that point. The probes are constructed of 12-gauge cold-rolled steel with an insulating coating on the back. Grounding wires are attached to the part, which completes the circuit from the probe. The probes are positive and the ground wires negative, same as the part, assuming cathodic electrocoating is used. The probes and ground wires are connected to the circuit board. The circuit board converts the signal from the probes into a signal the recorder can read. The signals are recorded at set time intervals. The leakproof container is a nonconductive pipe with a stand, handle, removable cap and a collar that the wires run through. The leakproof container houses the circuit board and recorder. Operation. A typical run starts by placing the recorder into the device and turning it on. The instrument is then sealed and placed inside the vehicle. The device is strapped to the vehicle with a bungee cord to prevent movement during the run. The ground wires are clamped to the vehicle, and the probes are placed on the vehicle. The instrument is removed after the electrocoating tank. Data from the recorder is down loaded into an IBM computer. The data create a line graph for each probe. Then the voltage curve for each probe is integrated, using Simpson's Rule (a mathematical equation for deriving the area under a curve). This area is expressed in "Subda Units." In addition, the data are used to determine factors from the run, such as peak voltage or peak current reached, and the time at or above a certain voltage. Data Analysis. Currently, data from the device can be used to determine the condition of an anolyte cell, estimate the film build, and determine the electrical field produced by an anolyte cell. In addition, the data are used to optimize the anolyte cell configuration and determine the behavioral characteristics of electrocoat in a production tank. The instrument was initially developed to analyze the behavioral characteristics of electrocoat in a production tank. Other capabilities were discovered and refined during development testing. The discovery and refinement of cell condition and film build provide insight into the data analysis for these characteristics. Data Analysis: Cell Condition. The device's ability to determine the condition of an anolyte cell is an important by-product of its use in an electrocoat operation. Equipment used in the Sub was initially developed and tested in a research laboratory. Lab Voltage Curve. After developing and testing the equipment, a leakproof container to house the equipment was built. Then the instrument was off to an assembly plant for its maiden voyage. It did not fair well on its maiden voyage. A few bugs had to be worked out, such as leaks, probes falling off, and the clamps and probes undergoing coating. These problems were resolved and successful runs were accomplished routinely. The curve for the plant run is different from the lab runs. The curves from the lab were smooth, no dips or peaks, so the results were somewhat unusual. A second run produced the same results. What was causing the irregularities in the plant voltage curve? Logic led to the assumption that the placement of the anolyte cells could affect the curve. The size and location of each anolyte cell were determined and then plotted on the chart with the voltage curve. The anolyte cells matched the peaks on the curve. The dips in the curve were between the cells. The device could detect whether or not the anolyte cells were working. Since the instrument was not originally intended for use as a diagnostic tool, to check anolyte cells, this was a bonus. Data Analysis: Film Build. The amount of electrocoat applied is mainly a function of voltage, time and temperature. The submersible data acquisition instrument measures time and voltage, the overall bath temperature is known so it would be only natural to assume the unit could determine film build. The concept sounded simple enough but it turned out to be a little more complicated. Once all of the bugs were worked out, the instrument was used frequently at many assembly plants. The data from the runs were compiled and graphed. The first instrument had the capability to measure voltage or current at four points. So for each run there would be a graph with four curves. Upon reviewing the graphs, it was noted that the curves, for different points on a vehicle, were different. The shape of the curve and the area under the curve depended on the location of the probe. The electrocoat film build is not the same for different locations of a vehicle. Exterior points are generally higher in film build than interior points. Could the shape and area under the curve be related to the film build for that location? The area under each curve was calculated using Simpson's Rule. The area under the curve was originally expressed in volt seconds. Volt seconds was later changed to "Subda Units." Subda Units for each curve were compared to the film build for each location. Correlation between Subda Units and film build did not exist for all runs taken as a whole. However, if the data were broken down by assembly plant, correlation for a single assembly plant seemed much better. The individual plant data was analyzed by linear regression technique. Correlation between volt seconds on the instrument output and measured film build was high when linear regression was performed on the data. When linear regression was used the correlation between film build and Subda Units was good; however, it was not good enough to accurately predict film build. Further refinements analyzed the data on a run by run basis. This appeared to be even better at accurately predicting film build. However this accuracy is run dependent. Two runs were used to illustrate the difference that can occur between runs. The data used the two runs was broken down by run. A linear regression was performed on the data for each run. The equation, from the linear regression, was used to create the calculated film build lines. The actual film build was then plotted on the calculated film build lines. The film build lines for the two runs are different. This was typical for all the plants. The difference for the two runs is attributed to tank temperature. There were many factors that affected the film build versus Subda Units, such as tank temperature, pH, line stops and oven temperature. The instrument measured film build mainly in recessed areas of a vehicle, which would normally be cut open for measurement. A probe is placed in the recessed area before the vehicle is assembled. The other probes are placed on the unit prior to the electrocoat tank. The data from the probes in the areas where the film build can be measured is analyzed by linear regression. The linear equation, resulting from the analysis, is used to determine the film build in the area that cannot be measured on the vehicle. Data Analysis: Electrical Field. The electric field produced in an electrocoat tank is a function of the shape of an anode, distance between anodes and shape of the anodes. Looking at assembly plants using flat anolyte cells, the electrical field of a flat cell is confined to the width of the cell. That is why a dip in the recorded voltage is seen between flat cells. The electrical field for a ccell or a tube cell spreads out beyond its width. In a plant that has ccells, the only dips that are in the voltage line are in areas with large gaps between the cells. The high peaks in the exterior floor pan are from bottom anodes. Also note the difference between the right and left door; the left door is higher in voltage than the right. The door hook for the right door had fallen out for this run, so the right door was closed. The left door was open, so it was closer to the anodes, thus a higher voltage. A comparison of the electrical field produced by the different types of anodes could not be done in the field, because conditions varied from plant to plant too much for good comparison. A laboratory experiment to test the fields of different anodes was designed and completed. An anolyte cell test stand was built and the different types of anodes were acquired. Careful precautions were included in the experimental design to ensure the same conditions existed for all anodes tested. The anodes were all equal in area and occupied the same space in the tank. The substrate was stationary and two monitoring probes were placed on the substrate. Probe 1 was placed directly in front of the anode and probe 2 was placed to the right of the anode. The tube cell appears to have the broadest electrical field using this test. Which implies more coating time for the substrate with this cell. Additional confirmation testing is now in progress. Data Analysis: Anode Configuration. The placement of anodes can affect film build, film build variability, and the minimum film build. Data from the data acquisition unit, in conjunction with film build data were analyzed to determine if anode placement could be changed to improve electrocoat film builds. Film build data are reviewed to determine where deficiencies might exist. Sub data are analyzed to determine the root cause of the deficiencies. Once the root cause is identified, actions are formulated to eliminate it. Assembly Plant X's electrocoat tank was designed with a large gap in the side anolyte cells between V1 and V2. The interior film build was affected by this gap. The voltages in V1 and V2 were operated at a higher set point to achieve interior film build. The higher voltages caused an excess amount of film build on the exterior of the vehicle, especially the vertical surfaces. This problem was resolved by adding an anolyte cell to the front of the tank and relocating the overhead anodes. The addition of the anolyte cells and relocation of the overhead anodes enabled Plant X to reduce the exterior film build, and increase the interior film build. The submersible data acquisition device has generated data that has opened up a whole new world that may benefit the electrocoat industry. The unit has provided insight into what actually happens inside an electrocoat tank. Data and information provided are helping build a knowledge base that will influence anode shape and configuration, the number of rectifiers in a system and the design of vehicles in the future. Further refinements and uses are still being explored in DuPont's coating laboratories to enhance this tool's effectiveness in the future.

By Janice Baker and Dr. John Durkee There are two reasons for wanting to understand the chemistry of halogenated cleaning compounds. The first is that you and other users may be reconsidering the use of hazardous halogenated cleaning solvents because of unsatisfactory performance with aqueous and other cleaning systems. The second is that there are some new halogenated cleaning compounds that are safe to use. We're going to take a look at the chemistry and performance of both the old and new solvents. You'll be more comfortable with the old, and more open-minded toward the new after you read this! CFC's Are Out? Well, it's finally over! No, not the wrangling between President Clinton and the Congress, nor the acrimonious remarks of Princess Di and Prince Charles, nor even the last day of O.J. in court. The phase-out of CFCs and methyl chloroform (1,1,1 trichlo-roethane) is finally over. Well...not exactly. Actually, there are two forces that will keep CFCs (and methyl chloroform) in use until around when O.J. finishes his court appearances. The forces are: (1) the EPA has exempted HCFC 141b from phase-out until the end of 1996 for those who are already using it; and (2) there will be legally imported methyl chloroform (and maybe CFC-113) available for some time, as predicted in Products Finishing. By the time the banned solvents are truly no longer available, HFC 43-10 mee and HCFC-225 ca/cb will have been evaluated by industry, and HFE-A should be commercially available. OK. Most people thought what they needed to know about cleaning chemistry was that MEK (methyl ethyl ketone) was different from MiBK (methyl isobutyl ketone), and that there was no such chemical as MRK (methyl Ruth ketone)! But now we have all these numbers describing solvents we should consider. Just what do they mean? Are these descriptive numbers made up by vendors, like WD-40, 501, or KZ-7? Just what are these chemicals, and how can we tell them apart? When should we use any of them, and just what should we expect from their use? Cleaning Chemistry HCFCs are chemicals whose structures contain hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine and carbon. That's why they're referred to as HCFCs (for hydro-chlorofluorocarbons). Why is the one called HCFC-141b in disfavor? Let's start with the numbering system. We know what an HCFC is. The numbers 141b refer to the composition of the chemical in terms of carbon, hydrogen, fluorine, and chlorine atoms. You need the following code to translate between those numbers and something you might want to know (its structure): The number [1] on the right refers to number of fluorine atoms. So a value of 1 means 1 fluorine atom. The second number [4] from the right is one more than the number of hydrogen atoms. So a value of 4 means 3 hydrogen atoms. The third number [1] from the right refers to one less than the number of carbon atoms. So a value of 1 means 2 carbon atoms linked together, which is ethane. Ethane has connections for 6 atoms, so we have 1 fluorine, 3 hydrogens; and by subtraction, 2 chlorines. So HCFC-141b means C2H3Cl2F. Its chemical name is dichlorofluorethane. What does the "b" mean? Well the "b" is necessary to distinguish between three different chemical structures that have the same formula, called isomers. There are different positions of the chlorine atoms: The naming code requires the most symmetrical isomer to be indicated by the number alone, without any lower-case letter following it. Here, symmetry means the sum of the atom weights attached to each of the two carbon atoms. Lower case letters higher in the alphabet are assigned to isomers being increasingly more asymmetrical. For example, HCFC-141b has three halogen atoms on one carbon and three hydrogen atoms on the other; while HCFC 141 a has the halogens split among the carbon atoms. If the compound were unsaturated (ethylene vs. ethane), there would be a fourth number from the right which would indicate the number of double bonds. Ethylene has one double bond. If bromine is present in place of part or all of the chlorine, the capital letter B follows the naming of the parent, on the right. And the number of bromine atoms is given by a number immediately to the right of the capital B. The reason you have heard of HCFC-141b is that it is a replacement for a very common cleaning agent: CFC-113. Incidentally, CFC is an abbreviation for chlorofluorocarbon. For CFC-113, we know that its formula must be C2H0F3Cl3. More conventionally, the formula would be given as C2F3Cl3. The chemical name of CFC-113 is trichloro-trifluoroethane. The reason chemical structure is important is that it tells us about how the chemical will perform. For example, chlorine atoms in molecules provide solvency, but increase concern about toxicity; fluorine atoms provide inertness and volatility, and add cost; and hydrogen atoms provide solvency and reduce inertness. Increased molecular weight increases boiling and flash points. Branched or isomeric molecules have lower boiling and flash points than their paraffinic relatives at the same molecular weight. Vaporized chemicals that are reactive with sunlight to form ozone in the earth's lower atmosphere are called VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds). We see the by-products of reactions with VOCs as smog. Examples include MEK, IPA, toluene/ xylene, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and D-Limonene. The photochemical reactivity of other compounds can be low enough that these compounds are defined by the EPA as not being VOCs. Examples are ethane, acetone, and parachlorobenzotrifluoride. But some compounds are so inert that they survive and populate the earth's upper atmosphere. Recent scientific data have shown that chlorine atoms in these compounds can be liberated by reaction with high-intensity UV light from the sun. The chlorine atoms react with ozone. These chemicals, containing chlorine atoms, are called ozone-depleting chemicals (ODCs). Cleaning solvents perform because of their solvency and the temperature of use. Both can be determined by structure. In vapor-degreasing applications, temperature is the boiling point. Generally, cleaning action is better at higher temperatures, as shown in Table I. The reason 1,1,1 TCA is so hard to replace in vapor-degreasing applications is that it is a wonderful solvent (high Kb) and it is used at a higher boiling temperature. HCFC 141b is a better solvent than CFC-113, but in vapor degreasing applications, some of that advantage is lost because it is used at a lower temperature. Finally, the addition of one chlorine atom to HCFC 141b should improve its solvency, but that gain is more than offset in CFC-113 by the loss of three hydrogens atoms and the gain of two fluorine atoms. HCFC-141b, 1,1,1 TCA, and CFC-113 are all ODCs. From the structures above, HCFC-141b and 1,1,1 TCA are very similar. You might speculate that they have similar reactivity with ozone; and the EPA rates them as being so. U.S. manufacture of all three is banned by Section 604 of the 1990 Clean Air Act. In an important announcement in June, 1995, however, EPA modified the restriction for HCFC-141b. The current situation is as follows: Manufacture of 1,1,1 TCA and CFC-113 are banned after January 1, 1996. This is unchanged. Manufacture of HCFC-141b is banned after January 1, 2003. This is unchanged. Applications, such as solvent cleaning, are banned at an earlier date. To be legally using HCFC-141b now, you had to be using it on April 18, 1994. All solvent cleaning applications were to have been banned on January 1, 1996. Many users and vendors of HCFC-141b, had petitioned the EPA to postpone the effective date of the ban. In June, EPA did! Existing users doing high-performance electronics cleaning and precision cleaning can continue to use HCFC-141b for an additional year: until January 1, 1997. Existing users doing metal cleaning with HCFC-141b were required to stop using it on the original ban date: January 1, 1996. These users are likely to be readers of Products Finishing. You can get information on replacement chemicals and processes from a variety of sources--including articles in a special series appearing in PF over the last two years. OK, that's what an HCFC is. Apparently, the chemicals we just reviewed will be around only in the short-term. With what chemicals will users replace them? Let's use our knowledge to learn how other cleaning solvents differ from one another, and we'll be able to draw some conclusions about potential replacements. Another HCFC, 225 ca/cb, is being considered by some users: There is a switch of chlorine and fluorine atoms between the first and third carbon atoms of the two isomers, "ca" and "cb." The product sold is an equal blend of both isomers. Its boiling point is 129F and its Kb value is 31. HCFC-225ca/cb, relative to HCFC 141b, has significantly higher molecular weight, but significantly more fluorine atoms per carbon atom. The boiling point of HCFC-225ca/cb is quite low for a compound with a molecular weight of 201 because the high fluorine content raises evaporation rate. Solvency is somewhat poorer because of the reduced chlorine and hydrogen content relative to HCFC-141b. But this is more than offset, as cleaning in vapor degreasers is done at the boiling point, and that of HCFC-225ca/cb is 30F higher. HCFC-225ca/cb is an ODC because the inertness conferred by the five fluorine atoms allows survival into the upper atmosphere, where the two chlorine atoms can react to decompose ozone. Because of its inertness and lesser chlorine content, however, HCFC-225ca/cb is not as harmful to the ozone layer as is HCFC-141b. Manufacture of HCFC-225ca/cb is not banned until 2020. HFC 43-10 mee is used both as a cleaning and a drying agent. It is called an HFC (NOT an HCFC, because it contains no chlorine). From the designation 43-10, you should know that its formula is C5H2F10, and there are no unsaturated double bonds, because there is no fourth digit in the naming code. The dash is used to show that there are only three digits in the naming code. The reason for the isomer designation "mee" is beyond the scope of this work. HFC 43-10 mee has no chlorine atoms which is why it is not an excellent cleaning solvent. But there are low concerns about toxicity, and it is not an ODC. HFC 43-10 mee can be used with light soils and particulates. Broad cleaning capability is obtained with azeotropes, and in cosolvent machines. This product is commercially available now. Both HCFC-225ca/cb and HFC 43-10 mee are significantly more expensive than HCFC-141b because they are new products and have high fluorine content. Thus they may not be of interest to those doing general metal cleaning. Certain compounds were developed recently to be both solvents and drying agents. They are called hydrofluoroethers (HFE). The "A" and "B" designations by the manufacturer are purely arbitrary, and are not part of the chemical naming system. Since they have no chlorine atoms, they won't be great solvents and won't be ODCs. Solvency of HFEs will come from the ether (oxygen) linkage and the hydrogen atoms. Also, the oxygen linkage will probably allow these compounds to form azeotropes with other compounds, such as alcohols. In this way, the solvency can be increased to allow metal-cleaning in vapor degreasers. Because HFEs don't have chlorine atoms, concerns about toxicity should be reduced. HFEs are forecast to be available by mid-1996. Another product is CH2BrCl (called BCM for bromochloromethane). Bromine is less stable than chlorine. It also raises more concerns about toxicity, and is more reactive with ozone. You are now experienced enough as cleaning chemists to predict that this molecule will have some solvency, but there will be serious concerns about toxicity and ozone-depletion. As of December 1995 EPA was evaluating the suitability of CH2BrCl for solvent-cleaning applications. There is a product called parachloro-benzotrifluoride (PCBTF). For metal cleaning it has the best solvency of the products we have examined. This is because of the presence of the chlorine atom and the benzene structure (the six-carbon ring). But both of those features also enhance concerns about toxicity. The three fluorine atoms enhance rate of evaporation, and PCBTF dries much faster than one would expect for its boiling point (282F). PCBTF is being used in cold-cleaning applications. The virtue of PCBTF is that since its photochemical reactivity is low, the EPA has exempted it as a VOC. Structures: How They Affect Cleaning and the Environment The four compounds: Trichloroethane, Trichloroethylene, Perchloroethylene, and Methylene Chloride; are the chlorinated solvents most commonly used for metal cleaning. We have learned that the high chlorine content per carbon atom guarantees excellent solvency. 1,1,1 trichloroethane (TCA or methyl chloroform) is stable enough that it survives to reach the earth's upper atmosphere and decomposes while consuming ozone. That's why its manufacture is banned after January 1, 1996. The other three compounds are somewhat less stable, and are not ODCs. They also are commonly used for metal cleaning. But because of the presence of the chlorine atoms, there is concern about toxicity. We have examined the structure of various chemicals that are or could be used for metalcleaning. We can understand why their use or manufacture is banned; why they are or are not good solvents; why there is or is not concern about toxicity; and why they evaporate rapidly. As to questions about how to use them, these are subjects for another article or book; or you may want to contact the authors.

The products are said to improve the look and durability of automobile exteriors with quality materials that are flexible and have proven field performance. The coatings give the appearance of a chrome finish but with certain advantages over chrome. Components can be made flexible, lightweight, corrosion resistant, recyclable and in a variety of two-tone and color finishes, depending upon specific products applications. Flexible Bright™ is a proprietary process for depositing metal over a plastic surface. The resulting discontinuous layer and clear urethane topcoat provide a tough, resilient bright finish. It survives five mph impact at -20F with no perceptible damage. Soft plastic applications can be folded nearly in half without cracking the metal surface. Since the metal is non-conductive, it does not corrode or delaminate, even if the surface is broken and subjected to salt spray. Liquid Bright™ is a spin-off of Flexible Bright™, created to extend its properties and chrome-like appearance to steel, aluminum and magnesium parts. The finish has completed physical part testing and exceeded performance specifications for CASS, filliform, thermal shock, simulated car wash, salt spray and Arizona Proving Ground.

The group recently released the report Impacts: Summary of Results from Programs Conducted by the Office of Industrial Technologies. The report summarizes the impacts of research, development, demonstration and technology transfer conducted through 1994 by the DOE and the Office of Industrial Technologies (OIT). These OIT-supported efforts aim to find and encourage cost-effective ways for U.S. industry to reduce energy consumption and minimize waste generation. Several projects are relative to the finishing industry. Among them is a project on dual-cure photocatalysts that reduce solvent use in coatings. The coatings, developed by 3M, reduced the amount of time needed for painting and coating. Coatings cure at temperatures as low as 60F. The system uses photocatalysts (activated by light) to simultaneously polymerize two monomers to produce a coating that does not emit VOCs. Using the new coatings, U.S. industry could reduce VOC emissions by an estimated 260,000 tons per year, according to the report. Another project involves a plating waste concentrator that reduces pollution, recovers chemicals and saves energy. ALVAL International developed the system and has 62 units in operation. The vapor-recompression evaporator is coupled to a single-effect evaporator that uses waste heat as the energy source. The two evaporators complement one another for maximum energy efficiency. The high-efficiency is due to the capture of energy from the vapor leaving the evaporator, which is recycled through a mechanical compressor. The system recovers 100 pct of plating metals for reuse. For more information on the waste concentrator or dual-cure coatings, contact D. Gish of DOE at 202-586-1741. The third project relative to finishing was a technology to reclaim and reuse wastewater and minimize hazardous waste. The system, developed by PPG Industries, Inc., reclaims and reuses wastewater generated during the cleaning of equipment used in water-borne painting. The contaminated water is collected separately from other wastes. It is then prefiltered to remove large solids. Next, it goes through ultrafiltration where suspended solids and high-molecular-weight particles are removed. The smallest impurities are removed by reverse osmosis. Reclaimed water is pumped to a storage tank. PPG has reduced the number of annual tanker truck trips to hazardous waste facilities from 65 to four. The system recovers 95 pct of the wastewater. For more information on this system, contact A. Schroeder at 202-586-1641.

The in-tank system pumps, filters, agitates and treats while eliminating leaks and spills because solution never leaves the tank. Traditionally, when the filter cartridges clogged and required changing, operators needed to lean the pump back or remove the pump from the solution. The SIFCA allows the operator to remove only a lightweight pipe assembly and filter cartridges. The pump stays intact and mounted on the tank. The SIFCA is particularly helpful in larger tanks where heavier, higher-flow-rate, in-tank systems are used. The unit provides up to 5,000 gph of filtered solution. The system also allows for the addition of pipe sparging assemblies for special agitation requirements without interfering with filter changes. Source: FLO KING Filter Systems, Longwood, Florida.

Why Is Drying So Hard With Aqueous Cleaning Technology? It's only water, so why does it take so long? . . . By John Durkee, II President Creative EnterpriZes Lake Jackson, Texas There are good reasons why aqueous cleaning technology does not providefast,high-quality parts drying. The reasons relate to the differences inphysicalproperties between water and other materials that do dry better. Aqueous technology has become the most popular replacement technologyfor partscleaning since the manufacture of ozone-depleting compounds (ODCs) wasbanned. Myindependent surveys suggest that in mid-1995 around three-fourths ofthosesurveyed are converting to aqueous technology compared to two-thirds atthis timein 1994. Suppliers tout (correctly, in many cases) that the proper aqueouscleaningagent and process can improve cleaning beyond that obtained from ODCs.End userslike it because of familiarity and perceived environmental security.Regulatorslike it for the latter reason. So users must love it after they haveconverted toit, right? Well, not necessarily so. End users' most common concern is that parts drying is seen as poor.Thatperception is generally correct. However, parts drying can be improvedwithaqueous cleaning technology. A Misconception. It is not that drying water from parts is slow,inefficient orof poor quality; it is that drying is perceived to be slow, inefficient orpoorlydone compared to drying done with ODCs. If we did not have the benchmarkof partsdrying with CFC-113 or methyl chloroform (1,1,1 trichloroethane), wewould not bedisappointed. Drying water from parts works as it always has worked. It has alwaysbeendifficult to dry water from intricate sections, and evaporating water frommetalsurfaces has always left mineral deposits as cosmetic defects. It is notthataqueous cleaning technology has been oversold by its proponents; it is justthatdrying parts has not been mentioned because it was not an advantage ofthetechnology. The Perfect Drying Fluid. First decide how you want to dry parts. If you look in many dictionaries for synonyms for drying, the word evaporation is often given. So, parts drying is evaporating water from part surfaces. The perfect fluid for evaporative drying would have the characteristics shown in Table I. The table suggests the type of problems that occur when trying to dry water from parts, relative to production or maintenance lines designed for use with methyl chloroform. Some problems are as follows: Water will not evaporate quickly from parts. Parts will have to be heated to the boiling point of water to transfer enough heat to provide the evaporation. Water will collect in complex sections. It will only be removed ifparts are heated to the boiling point of water to vaporize the water. Drying loads will not be reduced as much because there will not bemuch liquiddrainage from the parts. Parts may have mineral deposits as residue after the waterevaporates. How to deal with an imperfect fluid. Table II shows some actionsthat will enhance the drying of water. The actions are organized around the disadvantages shown in Table I. Those who dry parts without taking these (or similar) actions will seektoimprove parts drying by using what I call the "bigger hammer" theory. Thismeansthat they compensate for the natural problems of drying parts byincreasing airflow and temperature. This adds energy costs, and means the parts will bequitehot at the completion of the process. The question you have to ask about aqueous cleaning technology (or anytechnology) is whether or not its advantages outweigh the disadvantages.Formany, the advantages do outweigh the disadvantages. But for others, whovalueboth high-quality cleaning and high-quality drying, other processes shouldbeconsidered (co-solvent, chlorinated solvent, CO2). When you choose a parts cleaning process, you must learn to live with itsvirtues and faults. Some processes are better for those who value partsdrying;some are better for those who highly value parts cleaning. Drying is the flaw of aqueous technology. This article has pointed out thereasons for this situation, and offered some suggestions that have beenproven toimprove the quality and amount of time required to dry parts. PF TABLE I--The Perfect Drying Fluid Characteristic of Perfect Drying Fluid Physical Property Requirement Value for Methyl Chloroform Value for Water Evaporate quickly High vapor pressure at anytemperature High relative evaporation rate 340 mm Hg @ 122F 3 95 mm Hg @ 122F 0.21 Takes little energy to evaporate Low heatof evaporation 102 Btu/lb 970 Btu/lb Films of it won't cling to complex surfaces Low surface tension 28 dynes/cm 72 dynes/cm It drains easily from surfaces Lower viscosity for low frictional drag Higher density to enhance gravity force 0.79 cps 1.33 g/cc 1.0 cps 1.0 g/cc It has no non-volatile residue No dissolved salts None Does the phrase "hard water" have any meaning? TABLE II--How to Enhance Drying of Water Drying Problem Methods of Overcoming Drying Problem Reason for Use of Method Doesn't evaporate quickly Consider use of another wash fluid to remove the aqueous cleaning agent, possibly a combustible organic liquid. This liquid will evaporate more rapidly than water, but will add a VOC emission to the unit. Takes lots of energy to evaporate Decide what areas of the parts will be difficult to dry. Use second heater to overheat some of the air, and focus this air at the problem areas. Only heat selected part areas as necessary to evaporatewater on those areas. Films of water cling to complex surfaces Use focused high-velocity air jets to knock off films of water from the complex surfaces. Can be doneby hand or automated. Air velocity around 1,000 fps dislodges films of water,whereas a velocity of 100 fps evaporates some of the water. Water doesn't drain easily from surfaces Delay drying step for 30 to 90 sec. Use time to vibrate partsbasket at 1-10 cycles/sec over rinse bath to maximize drainage. It is much faster to "waste" 90 sec to drain the basket well, than to wait 5 minto vaporize the water or 10-15 min to heat the parts hot enough to vaporize the water. Water has non-volatile residue Rinse with mineral-free (deionized) water. This can add significant cost. Use centrifugal dryerwhich doesn't dry parts by evaporation. The evaporated water has no mineral residue. Water is "slung off" by centrifugal force, and the salts stay with the water.

When Henry Chen considered expanding his business, he found an opportunity in the production of OEM parts for major U.S. and Japanese auto makers. As owner of Prime Wheel of Harbor City, California, Mr. Chen and his team had become known as leaders in the production of chromium-plated aluminum wheels for the automotive aftermarket. Marketing well-respected product lines such as Prime Wheel, Image and Golden Wheel, the company's production capacity was good, producing up to 4,000 aluminum castings daily. All the chromium plating was sent to outside sources, sometimes to as many as seven job shops. Mr. Chen wanted to be in the driver's seat. Prime Wheel's stringent quality assurance department spotted rejects at the rate of 30 to 40 pct. Mr. Chen knew he had to make changes if Prime Wheel was going to shift into high gear. To maintain Prime Wheel's leadership position in the aftermarket and meet the increasing demand for OEM chromium-plated aluminum wheels, the company would have to accelerate production capacity. Mr. Chen also wanted to institute an even higher level of quality management. He decided the best way to control all of this was to take plating in-house. A major expansion was needed to house the new finishing system. Working with Consultant Tom Beckwith, Mr. Chen set out to design and construct a fully automated chromium plating line. The new system, which took two months to design and 10 months to build, features state-of-the-art equipment, each with its own back-up system. According to plating operation designer and construction supervisor, Mr. Beckwith, "Every procedure in the system has a back-up, including the boiler. This system was designed to meet and surpass the regulations of the extremely stringent South Coast Air Quality Management District. They are using this operation as a benchmark site for future standards." Prime Wheel's plating expansion included an additional 30,000 sq ft, bringing the total manufacturing area to 600,000 sq ft. Prime Wheel now employs more than 1,000 people. Future plans also call for the construction of a 110,000-sq-ft production plant, which will increase casting production to more than 200,000 wheels per month. To accomplish the desired levels of production and quality in its plating operation, Prime Wheel's plating tooling provider, Custom Industrial Rack, built the plating fixtures. Cosmos Minerals Corporation fabricated proprietary designed auxiliary anode hookups. Due to the complex designs of some of Prime Wheel's wheels, extremely precise plating procedures are required. These intricate auxiliary anodes are used to chromium plate hard-to-reach recesses and contours of the wheel designs. Mr. Beckwith noted, "The special design of these auxiliary anodes is a critical element in the success of this plating operation." Cosmos was asked also to provide anode baskets, special heating coils and shell-and-tube heat exchangers. On board as finishing consultant and acting plant manager during the activation of the new plating line, Tom Beckwith instituted a strong set of guidelines for Prime Wheel's quality control procedures. Multiple checks and testing throughout the process include: Plating adhesion tests, in which the finished product must endure a torturous 45 min bake at 410F; Reverse saw cutting; and Micro-cross-section to ascertain consistency of plating thicknesses and grain structure analysis. Prime Wheel's high quality plating can also be attributed to two procedures special to the plating industry. First, each Prime Wheel part receives a special initial treatment jointly designed by Brent America and Prime Wheel. Following this process, each wheel receives a proprietary pre-plate procedure before entering the first plating bath. Brent America, Inc. provided the proprietary chemistry and technical support on the new wheel plating line from the immersion soak tank and power washer through the pre-plate immersion tanks. In addition to supplying pretreatment chemicals, Brent America also provided the pretreatment system for the powder coating operation and wastewater treatment chemistry. Plating chemistries are supplied by Taskem. Acclaim HPD process is used for plating bright acid copper. Copper metal is maintained at approximately 41 g/liter. Too high of a copper level will influence the maximum current density as well as the covering and throwing power of the solution. Deposit thickness would increase in high-current-density areas and decrease in low- current-density areas. Also, high copper levels can cause copper sulfate crystals to form on the anodes and tank walls, causing poor anode corrosion and deposit roughness. It is also important for Prime Wheel to maintain both the anode and cathode current density. Too high a cathode current density causes burning and granular deposits. Too low a cathode current density reduces plating speed and can cause the copper metal concentration to rise. Too high an anode current density causes anode polarization and a decrease in copper metal concentration. Too low a current density causes deposit roughness because the anodes dissolve non-uniformly. A typical operating procedure is listed in Table I. Criterion Maxima AP bright nickel produces a uniform deposit over a range of current densities. pH is checked daily and adjusted. Hull cells are used for plating bath analysis. Nickel sulfate and nickel chloride supply the nickel ions in the solution. The nickel chloride also improves the bath's conductivity and anode corrosion. Cathode current density in Prime Wheel's nickel bath is the total current to the tank divided by the total cathode surface area. This allows for a wider operating current density range without burning. The anode current density is calculated the same way, except the current to the tank is divided by the total anode surface area. A typical cycle is outlined in Table II. Prime Wheel's new plating system was designed to include 32 tanks in a 160-ft line, with a work capacity of 12 wheels every five min. With its expanded capacity, Prime Wheel will increase its production from 80,000 to 200,000 units per month. The company's testing and quality assurance have also seen a significant change, with a rejection rate of under one pct. With the move from outside sources to inside plating, Prime Wheel has increased its production capacity tenfold. According to Prime Wheel's executive vice president of sales and marketing, Webb Carter, "This production expansion will help insure Prime Wheel's market position. Prime Wheel will now be able to keep more substantial and diverse inventories readily available for its customers. Additionally, Prime Wheel now has the control and capability to convert to meet OEM requirements as requested by automotive manufacturers." So, what about Henry Chen's vision of expansion? It appears that Mr. Chen's success plan is right on target. Prime Wheel is negotiating with two major auto manufacturers to supply their chromium-plated aluminum wheel business.

Graves, Editor Vance Darlage was set for life. He worked in the family agricultural business, made a decent living, started a family and planned to "grow old" in his hometown of Seymour, Indiana (pop. 15,576). However, this enterprising young man was not content to simply follow the road map placed before him. A street rod enthusiast, Mr. Darlage occasionally took his car parts to a local company for stripping and derusting. After a while, however, he decided to do it himself. Although he retained his job at the fertilizer manufacturing company, he took a chance and opened a paint stripping and derusting business in 1989. The 8,000-sq-ft shop in downtown Seymour had two vats, a fork truck and one employee, not Mr. Darlage. After a year Mr. Darlage could no longer work one job and run Metal Prep, so he quit his job at the agricultural company and worked for his own company full time. In 1992 the business moved from the small downtown shop to a larger, 30,000-sq-ft building just outside of Seymour. By May, 1995, Metal Prep added 23,000 sq ft of manufacturing space. It was no longer a two-dip operation. It currently has almost 50 employees and more than 100 customers in 12 states. The company now boasts three automated turntable washers, blast cleaning, bake-off ovens, vibratory equipment as well as three powder coating lines and a fleet of trucks. Before parts are stripped, cleaned or derusted, the type of material and coating to be removed must be determined. An MSDS on the coating to be removed is reviewed to comply with EPA regulations and company environmental policy. After that, the most effective removal method is applied. Three Proceco turntable washers and the bake-off ovens do the majority of the work at Metal Prep; however no system is ever idle long. The automated washers handle large, heavy parts, such as engines for large generators and mining trucks. The engines are shipped to Metal Prep for cleaning and degreasing prior to rebuilding. Two of the washers are stationed approximately 30 ft apart with an overhead hoist system running between them. This is used to load the heavy engines and other parts onto racks. The racked parts are then positioned in the nine ft tall washers. The five ft wide turntables have a capacity of 5,000 lbs. Inside the systems the wash manifold and V-jet spray nozzles provide fan-shaped, high-velocity, high-impact cleaning spray from the top, bottom and sides. The turntable rotates on permanently lubricated ball bearings. An adjustable roller chain permits slippage when falling parts obstruct free rotation. The control system features a cycle timer that allows operators to set individual cycle times for wash, rinse, fresh water rinse, blow-off and exhaust stages. Control cycles are programmed into the system so that each time a part arrives at Metal Prep the cycle is simply called up and run without reprogramming. The washers also feature an automatic sludge removal and grease skim conveyor that automatically scrapes sludge from the tank bottom and skims floating grease from the solution surface. Parts as large as car bodies and many smaller ones are stripped in burn-off ovens, including some that are subsequently sent to the washers. Metal Prep has four bake-off ovens. The smallest oven is 10-by-8-by-10 ft and the largest is 10-by-10-by-18 ft. The ovens are used to strip paint, adhesives and other substances from a variety of parts. Stripping paint and powder coatings requires approximately two to four hrs, depending on the amount and type of coating and the oven temperature. For example, if 100 fixtures are cleaned each hr, then the oven used is one sized for 250 to 450 parts. A space is allowed that is equal to one diameter between fixtures for hot gas and cooling water spray to circulate. When parts are in the ovens, sufficient space is allowed for hot gases to circulate between parts. An oven load of parts and/or fixtures requires five to eight hrs, depending on processing temperature. Some of the large engines are baked to remove adhesives and other materials prior to washing in the turntable washing system. The ovens also have a fire prevention system. Ovens do not actually burn off the coating or other contaminants, since this could cause the parts to become extremely hot and warp or melt. Instead, the ovens thermally decompose the solids into a combustible vapor in a low-oxygen atmosphere to inhibit combustion and then destroy the vapor in an afterburner. The dynamic response system in Metal Prep's ovens monitors the combustible vapor concentration and controls it at a safe level. The system responds to the load and does not require operator intervention. The ovens use a rate-of-change control system, which is a factory programmed system that continuously monitors the heat-up rate of the oven chamber and the afterburner. If either heats up too rapidly, the load is cooled until the heat rate is acceptable. If water systems fail to cool the load, the primary burner automatically shuts off to stop the process. The oven also has an automatic cycle timer that senses when the oven is no longer producing combustible vapor and is up to the pre-selected temperature. This indicates that the oven can be safely shut off without releasing smoke to the atmosphere. A second thermocouple in the coolest part of the oven assures that parts are uniformly heated before shut-off. Once parts are baked they go through a chemical process for derusting and ash removal. Another method of metal cleaning at Metal Prep is plastic shot blasting. This is done largely on aluminum substrates, such as wheels and the aluminum pieces on engines. Metal Prep also has a small vibratory system for deburring smaller parts. In addition to all this metal cleaning, derusting and preparation, Metal Prep can also powder coat parts. It has one manual batch coating line and a conveyorized line. All lines are manufactured by Nordson Corp. The conveyorized line has heavy I-beam conveyors to hang parts up to 400 lbs. It can accommodate parts with dimensions up to two and a half by four and a half by five-ft one-inch. Prior to powder coating, parts go through a five-stage pretreatment system. The sequence is cleaner, rinse, iron phosphate, rinse, rust preventive and sealer. The iron phosphate from the pretreatment line is used to lower the pH in wastewater treatment. Parts are then dried in a direct-fired, forced-air oven. The conveyorized powder coating system features a polypropylene powder coating booth with a three by five ft vestibule opening. A powder reclamation device is inherent to the system. Six automatic reciprocating Versa-Spray guns and two manual guns are used to spray the variety of parts. Colors primarily used are black and white, but a number of colors are used regularly. Parts are cured using gas-fired ovens. The powder coating batch line handles parts six-by-six-by-15 ft. Metal Prep's quality assurance includes a continuous improvement program. "We are becoming more automated," noted Mr. Darlage. "Automation helps with quality control, production and safety. We only have one caustic dip tank left, and we would like to eliminate that." The company uses no chlorinated solvents. All chemicals used for stripping and derusting are biodegradable. Metal Prep can provide transportation using trucks ranging from one ton to 48-ft tractor/trailers, ensuring timely pickup and delivery. The chance Vance Darlage took in 1989 has paid off. He attributes the growth to total communication with his customers, providing the best service and a commitment to environmental safety by not using cold strippers and adhering to EPA prescribed disposal methods. Not only is Mr. Darlage running a successful business, he was named 1996 Small Business Person of the Year by the Seymour Chamber of Commerce.

By Beverly A. Graves Editor As the coil of metal turns, it releases an intricately shaped ribbon of parts. The ribbon progresses through a series of cleaners, rinses and plating baths. As it winds around a spool at the opposite end of the plating line, there is a tiny spot of gold on the tip of each part. It may sound simple, but plating electronic components is anything but easy. Ask the Belmonti family at Precision Plating Company, Inc., in Chicago, Illinois. "Electronics plating involves high technology, tiny parts, extensive engineering, a clean environment, efficiency, precious metals, a commitment to quality and customer satisfaction," noted Jeff Belmonti, national sales manager for the family business. Precision Plating has been in the business of precious metal plating since 1904, when it plated picture frames with gold for Marshall Field's department store. Owned then by the Zacharais family, business increased during World War I along with the company's expertise at precious metal plating. As personal computers and other electronic devices debuted in the general consumer market, the company's expertise with precious metal plating was in demand. However, during the economic recession in 1989 the original owner's family decided to sell. That is when James Belmonti, who was then vice president of technology, decided to buy the company. His vision was to be the provider of choice for the application of highly engineered plated finishes that result in 100 pct customer satisfaction. The company's dedication to high-quality, high-technology plating has earned it the business of some notable, world-class electronics manufacturers: IBM, Delco, Winchester Electronics, AT&T, Berg, Bourns, Breed Automotive and Motorola. President James Belmonti is the driving force behind the success of the company. "He loves plating, pure and simple," stated his son Jeff. "He wants to give the customer the best finish for its part at the best price. "We found that many of the engineers that specify certain finishes on the electronic parts do not understand what we do," explained Jeff. "They are concerned about cost, so we show them how costs can be reduced through selectivity of the deposit." To help customers understand how continuous selective electroplating works, James Belmonti developed a manual on the various methods. Within the manual is an example of a plating specification sheet that is essentially the customer specification, translated into Precision's computerized color-coded format. This specification drawing can be pulled up on computers in the lab, on the plating line, in the accounting office or at any other station in the facility. A process control plan for each job also is established and can be pulled up on computers throughout the plant. The manual includes descriptions of the plating processes available to the electronics industry. The company plates hard and soft gold; palladium/nickel and palladium from AT&T Nassau Metals; copper, nickel sulfate and sulfamate and sulfonic tin/lead solutions. The recent growth and interest in palladium/nickel finishes, plated by Precision since 1983, is supported through the use of electroplating chemicals and services of AT&T Bell Laboratories. The following are comprehensive excerpts from Mr. Belmonti's manual describing each technology. Continuous (reel-to-reel) plating provides a cost advantage because the process selectively plates only a designated area. The metals plated include gold, palladium/nickel, palladium, copper, nickel, tin and tin/lead solders. The principle of reel-to-reel plating is deceptively simple. In reel-to-reel plating, unplated material is unwound from a feed coil and conveyed through a series of processing stations and recoiled on a take-up reel. Because of the shape, size and fragility of the material being plated, and the number of difficult and complex plating specifications, it is a relatively complex operation that must be customized for each application. In reel-to-reel plating the strip material is conveyed through the equipment horizontally or vertically. A processing (plating, rinse) station has two sections: the upper process cell and the lower reservoir tank. Solution is pumped from the reservoir tank into the upper cell where it flows over weirs and back to the reservoir. Solution heating and filtration is done in the reservoir. As the plated material leaves each process cell, air knives and/or soft rubber wipers, remove dragout. DI spray rinses follow each process station. At each processing station, the strip must be made cathodic or anodic. This is accomplished using several types of electrical contact configurations. The contact type depends on part style. A firm contact force is necessary to prevent interruption of current, but not so firm as to damage the part. Plating lines require emphasis on "one-pass" operations that allow cleaning, rinsing, selective or overall copper and/or nickel undercoats, selective tin or solder and occasionally an electropolishing operation in one run through the line. This requires plating lines of 80 ft or longer. Continuous controlled-depth plating. This is the simplest method of selective plating. With this method, parts are immersed partially in the plating solution. The height of the deposit is set with adjustable solution-overflow weirs and by the position of the guide sprockets. Some over-plating can occur due to the difficulty of controlling solution levels. This type of plating sometimes requires custom tooling. Continuous moving-belt mask plating. Belts made of soft rubber bonded to an insoluble metal backing strip prevent the plating solution from reaching the parts' surface except for exposed narrow bands on the parts. The plating solution is jetted from a plating cell through slots in the masking belts, which are firmly pressed against and moving with the strip. Solid material and pre-formed components can be plated with one or more stripes on one or both sides of the strip. Continuous belt-and-drum plating. With this type of plating a rubber-covered drum masks the back of the strip being plated, and two rubber belts are used to produce the selectively plated stripe. The width and location of the stripe are controlled by the placement of the belts. This system can also be used for tip plating by allowing the material to protrude laterally from between the drum and the masking belt. Continuous spot plating (step and repeat). Small, well defined, round or rectangular plated spots are produced with spot plating. To obtain spots in precise locations, pre-punched guide or pilot holes are used. This allows parts (strip) to move continuously through the pre-plate and post-plate sections. The plating masks are precision molded silicon rubber that are opened and closed using a clamshell-type mechanism. Typically, a 24-inch section is indexed per each movement of the materials. This type of selective plating provides precise location of well-defined and discreet plated spots. Continuous (brush) plating. With this type of plating, an absorbent medium, such as felt, introduces plating solution only on the required plating area. This medium may be a roller or any configuration that best complements the contact form. Brush plating limits plating to the raised contacting surfaces of electrical contacts. This method can be used to plate only one or two sides of rectangular connector pins. Precision Plating also offers conventional rack and barrel plating. A new automated rack/barrel line was recently installed for plating copper, nickel and bright acid tin. The line features plating tanks and rinse stations from Hardwood Line and Poly Products, Inc. The rinse stations provide extensive rinsing in a single station. This saves money on water and allows for faster plating. The plating line is controlled by a Geotronics DS4000 control system. The system provides total control of load scheduling, sequencing, hoist positioning, rectifier control, time-in-tank and other operating parameters. By simply "clicking on" the desired plating tank on the computer screen, operators can find out the temperature, time-in-tank and next processing step, as well as the job number for the part. In addition to the control system on the line, the company has a lab that routinely tests all plating solutions. Some of the equipment includes Hull cells, surface tensiometer, contractometer UV for additives analysis, pH meters, a Perkin Elmer 5000 atomic absorption spectrophotometer, deposit purity, and a Mettler MT-5 scale for measuring products in micrograms up to six decimal places. Equipment for inspecting plated finishes includes several Fischerscope x-ray fluorescence systems; porosity chambers, contact resistance testers, Steam age solderability chambers, various adhesion testers and other testing and measuring equipment. All of this helps the company live up to its name and its vision, "To be the provider of choice for the application of highly engineered plated finishes that result in 100 pct customer satisfaction."

This year's report focuses on several issues, including strategic planning, information technology and financial management. A product that is good, fast and available at a desirable price is not good enough anymore. Customers now demand and expect to receive everything precisely how and when they want it at the most competitive price. This will be the driving force behind many business decisions in the next several years, according to the survey. The survey also notes that larger industries are creating tighter, longer lasting and more demanding relationships with midsize suppliers in an effort to improve quality and keep costs down. So what is this doing to the midsize company, a category many finishing plants fall into (annual sales between $10 and $500 million)? One area that many midsize companies are reviewing is strategic planning. The survey asked these companies what they feel is the most critical attribute to manufacturing success. Thirty-eight percent answered high-quality products, with superior customer service running a close second at 33 pct. The survey also asked the companies to list their priorities for strategic planning. Ninety-five percent of the midsize companies plan to meet with their major customers to discuss ways of maximizing their value to that customer. Other strategies companies planned to implement included setting aside time for reviewing long-term objectives; involving key suppliers in planning; developing a written strategic plan; and re-thinking production. One area where midsize companies work with their customers is designing products. Half of those surveyed jointly design products with their customers, and 37 pct design the entire product. Working together to design the product helps the midsize manufacturing company "fit" the product to his capabilities. One other area the survey included was investing in information technology. Fifty-two pct planned to make a significant investment in information technology in 1995. The dollar amounts companies planned to invest averaged $463,200. Most of the money was earmarked for major investments in computer hardware (62 pct). When asked about building or relocating production facilities, 53 pct noted that they will build or relocate. The reason for this was to move closer to customers. However, several cited that the move would help lower costs, provide them with a better labor pool, and lower taxes. The biggest tax burden for most midsize companies is federal taxes.

By Bo Quick and John Adams Environmental Engineers Conversion Technology, Inc. Norcross, Georgia Increased demand for environmental protection and worker safety has placed a significant burden on more than 5,000 electroplating and surface finishing facilities nationwide. They must maintain regulatory compliance while remaining competitive. At the forefront of the incredible mass of federal and state regulations are the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA). Due to the nature of the business, anodizers and electroplaters (especially those using hexavalent chromium) have been and will continue to be targeted as contributors to toxic air emissions. With the CAAA, companies are forced to evaluate their emissions to determine their facility's air quality status under Title V. Many facilities that were exempt from permitting in the past or were considered Minor Sources are now required to obtain new air quality permits. This is due to newly established Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) or changes in state regulations. It is essential that you correctly prepare a permit application. These eight fundamental steps will help you permit your finishing facility accurately and completely. AIR QUALITY PERMITTING PROCESS 1. Identify Emissions Sources. Evaluate your facility for all possible air emission sources: plating, anodizing, painting, fuel-burning equipment. This includes less obvious sources such as solvents used in parts cleaning and other fugitive emissions not emitted from a specific stack or vent. Determine if any planned activity will generate any new sources or modify existing sources. 2. Quantify Emissions. Determine actual and potential emissions from each source using material balance calculations, source testing data, accepted emission factors, manufacturers' documentation, representative testing data from similar processes or other methods accepted by your state. Do not use estimates or assumptions, if possible. Your state will require supporting information to confirm these estimates or ask you to perform source testing. 3. Review Regulations. Obtain a copy of the air quality regulations for your state. Review any applicable regulations to answer the following questions. Are any sources at the facility exempt from permitting? Do any sources have emissions limitations? Are any sources subject to federal regulations for New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), New Source Review (NSR) requirements, Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards or other requirements? Are your facility's emissions large enough to require a permit? For example, in some states, emissions of VOCs less than 10 tons/year do not require a permit. Is the facility located in a non-attainment area? Be aware that some states have VOC emission limitations more stringent than Title V, particularly for heavy industrial and vehicular traffic areas. 4. Determine Compliance Status. There are several techniques for evaluating compliance. Some states perform plume dispersion modeling analysis or require applicants to do so to determine concentration of certain pollutants (air toxics) at ground level. It is best to perform the analysis yourself, before the state knows of any compliance problems. Failing a plume dispersion model can be corrected sometimes by simple modifications to emissions points, such as increased stack height, increased exhaust flow rate or removal of rain caps. By comparing emissions levels to applicable air quality regulations, you should determine if all sources of air pollution at your facility are in compliance. Sources whose emissions exceed state or federal emission limits are more difficult to correct. Pollution control equipment may need to be installed, or some change in the process may have to be made. If any emissions sources are out of compliance and cannot be remedied easily, a compliance plan must be established. It may be necessary to work out a compliance schedule with your state. Do not blindly submit a permit application without knowing your facility's complete compliance status. You may be subject to enforcement action for every year your facility operated out of compliance. 5. Evaluate Title V Status. In the second step, you should have calculated actual and potential emissions for each source at your facility. Potential emissions are not computed by simply scaling actual emissions at your current operating schedule to 8,760 hr/yr. Potential emissions are those emissions that would occur if a source operated on a continuous basis, at its maximum capacity and without any pollution control devices. Even if your facility has a process that is included in your current air permit but is not operated, its potential emissions must be considered when calculating potential emissions. Your facility will be categorized as an Exempt Source if emissions are below levels that require a permit; Minor (Small) Source if actual and potential emissions are below Title V thresholds for all pollutants; Synthetic Minor (Conditional Major) if actual emissions are below Title V levels, potential emissions are over Title V levels, and the facility is willing to accept federally enforceable operating limitations to guarantee that emissions will remain below Title V thresholds; or Major Source if actual emissions are over Title V levels or the facility would be a Synthetic Minor but is unable or unwilling to accept operating limitations that will guarantee that emissions will remain below Title V levels. 6. Prepare Permit Application. The next step is to prepare the air quality permit application. If you are a Major Source and preparing a Title V Operating Permit application, several other items are required. Depending on your situation, you may have to propose record-keeping plans, periodic or enhanced monitoring protocols and/or reporting procedures to demonstrate compliance. If you are an anodizer or chromium electroplater, you may be subject to Maximum Achievable Control Technology requirements. 7. Submit Permit Application. If your facility is particularly complex or if emissions are precariously close to Title V levels, submit a draft permit application to your state, if allowed. This will allow the permit review engineer an opportunity to assess your facility/application and make comments or ask questions. It will also give you the opportunity to make changes to the application should any corrections be necessary. When you submit the final application, be sure to include payment for any applicable fees. Depending on the state, you may have to pay an application processing fee or construction/modification fee. 8. Make Preparations to Comply with Permit. Depending on your situation, you may be required to perform source testing, waste sampling, recordkeeping and reporting to comply with your permit. You may also be required to pay emissions fees. It has become nearly an impossible task for facilities to keep up with all of the environmental, health and safety requirements to achieve and maintain compliance. With Air Quality Control issues on the minds of legislators and the public, federal and state agencies are paying closer attention to the plating and surface finishing industry. Facilities must quantify their emissions, determine how they are classified under Title V and begin the permitting process. PF To contact the authors, call 404-263-6330.

Kenneth J. Saulter and Marie Jones Industrial Technology Institute Ann Arbor, Michigan and Lawrence C. Boyd, Jr. Cleveland Advanced Manufacturing Program Cleveland, Ohio Product finishing is an energy and environmentally intensive manufacturing service. Yet, to our knowledge, there are no measures of operational efficiency for energy, environment or manufacturing. There is no scale to determine how well individual companies are doing over time or relative to other finishers. In part, this is due to a wide-spread belief that each finisher is unique and cannot be compared to other finishers. It is a fairly complex problem to figure out how to collect and analyze data that would allow companies to compare themselves with others in the industry. Issues like proprietary concerns and confidentiality have to be addressed in order to get companies to provide the information necessary to make performance comparisons possible. For an industry that is heavily influenced by changes in environmental regulations and energy markets, monitoring performance relative to others ought to be a priority. Otherwise, finishers may assume too much and end up playing catch-up every year. ITI's surveys have found that companies have a consistently inflated opinion of how well they perform relative to others in their industry. Half of all metal fabricators surveyed rated themselves in the top 10 pct on measures like quality and productivity. Now, product finishers have a source of information to use for evaluating their industry performance. The Performance Benchmarking Service of ITI (Industrial Technology Institute) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with the help of a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) project, surveyed the product finishing industry. The results of the survey are the subject of another article. Through this Products Finishing article we want to bring to large numbers of metal finishers a convenient, confidential way to self-evaluate their operations in the energy, environment and manufacturing areas using the following 16-question EEM Self-Assessment Tool for Metal Product Finishers. As a product finisher, do you know your company's strengths and weaknesses? Do you know how much you spend on energy per month, or on waste treatment and disposal? More importantly, are there areas where you think you lag behind your competition? Understanding which areas positively and negatively impact your productivity and profitability helps with improvement. The EEM Self Assessment Tool for Metal Product Finishers is self-contained. You provide the answers and the answer key provides your status among metal finishers in the three critical areas of your business: energy efficiency, environmental management and manufacturing performance. Even if you know your business well, you can still use this self-assessment tool to compare and track your company's performance changes over time. The EEM Self-Assessment Quiz. Product finishing companies from all regions of the country completed an extensive survey covering all aspects of their business operations. The data are updated regularly as new questionnaires are completed. All company names and identifying data are strictly confidential to ensure the data is accurate. The finishing industry is well represented, with more than 100 respondents used to develop the tool. Seventy-eight pct of companies participating in the survey were product finishers. Twenty-two pct of the companies were primarily metal coaters. Of the product finishers, most engaged in a wide variety of plating processes: 60 pct plated primarily chrome and cadmium; 38 pct plated primarily nickel, copper and trivalent chrome; and 15 pct plated primarily tin, zinc and/or aluminum. Only two pct plated precious metals. Circle one answer for each question. The Answer and Evaluation key follow. Information is provided with the questions to explain why they were selected. Manufacturing Performance 1. Percent Change in Sales over Past Two Years. Sales have been increasing throughout in the product finishing industry. Sales growth is often a requirement for improved margins. Percentage change in sales equals 1994 sales, minus 1992 sales, divided by 1992 sales. Where do you stand? Circle only one. (A) 68% or more (B) 41 - 67% (C) 21 - 40% (D) 3 - 20% (E) Less than 3% 2. Training, Tuition and Fees per Employee. Money invested in employee training can result in savings in the future, due to increased worker efficiency and productivity. To determine how many employees you have, use your average for the year (not year end counts) and convert part-time and contract labor to full-time equivalents.

Wyandotte, Michigan Rivets, because of their small diameter and blind holes, are difficult to clean. Detroit Tubular Rivet, Inc. manufactures a variety of rivets in many sizes and lengths. These rivets carried excessive oil into plating process tanks and the waste treatment system causing headaches and expense for the company. A new, automated vapor degreaser solved the problem and cut costs as well. Before the system was installed, the automatic barrel plating system included two hot alkaline soaks and one electrocleaning station. Each station was also equipped with oil skimming and removal. Although this was recommended as an adequate cleaning system, it was not. Oil was carried into subsequent process tanks, causing many problems. Various types of precleaning processes were researched. None of the aqueous or semi-aqueous processes, whether spray, rotation or immersion was effective. The only cleaning process that eliminated oil from process tanks was vapor degreasing. Before vapor degreasing, so much oil accumulated in the cleaning tanks that each Sunday, when alkaline cleaning tanks were cold, oil was skimmed off and transferred to a holding tank. pH was reduced to two and the waste treated with a coagulant. Three 55-gal drums of oil were skimmed off each Monday. Since installing the new degreaser, the company has not had to do this. As a result of the study, the company purchased a chlorinated solvent vapor degreaser from Finishing Equipment, Inc. The system uses methylene chloride as the solvent. This automated, enclosed system handles up to 500 lbs of rivets at one time. Since installation, no oil has been carried into the plating process, resulting in a significant improvement in quality. Oil is recovered and reused in manufacturing process, saving $50,000 annually. Detroit Tubular has reduced use of alkaline cleaners by one-third and acids by 70 pct. The acid savings are made because acids cannot work on oily surfaces; it retards their function. Removing the oil allows the acids to work more effectively. Also, less rinse water is required. Another benefit results from the degreaser cooling system. It is cooled with an air-cooled chiller. In the summer, the chiller's heated air is discharged outside and the extra ventilation keeps the shop cool. In the winter, heated air contributes to heating the shop. Explosions on the plating and electrocleaning tank were eliminated. The hydrogen and oxygen generated at the zinc tank and in a surface foam commonly caused explosions. Oil in the plating tank made the explosions more violent, to the extent of actually burning the ceiling over the plating tank. These explosions have been reduced to zero from the previous 15 to 20 per day. The waste treatment system now functions properly. Flocculation, settling and filtering of plating sludge proceeds on schedule. Prior to this, oil prevented these systems from functioning properly. Zinc sludge in the sludge dryer is no longer ignitable. The sludge is suitable for sale and recycling. The system uses only five gal of methylene chloride per day to clean 40,000 lbs of rivets daily. There are other intangible benefits with this machine. Solvent degreasing has minimized energy costs and wastes. The degreasing system has been permitted by Wayne County and Michigan under their regulations and toxic rules. Methylene chloride is exempted as a VOC by EPA, does not deplete the ozone, and personnel exposure and shop conditions are acceptable. No other cleaning system could accomplish for Detroit Tubular what the new methylene chloride degreasing system has done.

This doctor isn't going to give you much guidance about curing your ulcers, nor even suggest Mylanta, but he may help you to solve a problem that has been causing your discomfort. He's Dr. Arthur Kushner, Ph.D., the new "answer-man" for our Plating Clinic column. We welcome Art, who takes the place of our retiring long-time Plating-Clinic columnist, Larry Durney. I've known Art for all of his adult life. He's a good friend as well as a business associate. Indeed I knew his father, too the late Dr. Joseph B. Kushner. Joe was a professor and founder of a correspondence course in electroplating that bears his name. He was the author of "Water and Waste Control for the Plating Shop," now in its third edition and still the authoritative source of information on this subject. It was the first book published by PRODUCTS FINISHING. I was the editor, and Joe and I shared a "learning experience." (Translation: publishing a book was harder and more time-consuming than either of us would have anticipated.) Arthur contributed to subsequent editions. So the Kushner family and PF have a long-time close relationship. Arthur recalls that during his first visit to a plating shop, at age 12, he passed out after about one minute, walking along the line. After being revived outside the shop, he heard the plant manager telling his father that the lad just hadn't yet developed "a tolerance for cyanide." Art received his Ph.D. in chemistry from Pennsylvania State University. During his college years he worked with his father on research projects about stress in electroplated nickel. He later taught at the college level and was involved in research and other technical activities in a number of companies. Then when his father died in 1978, he took over the Kushner Electroplating School. Since then he has augmented his electroplating-related activities by providing classroom plating instruction, and consulting. PF has a good and competent person to help you with your technical questions about electroplating.

By Francis J. DeSilva and Michael C. Gottlieb ResinTech, Inc. Cherry Hill, New Jersey Metal salts dissolve in water and split into ions, which carry an electric charge. The ionic forms of dissolved metals, cations, carry a positive charge. Ions can be modified or removed using ion-exchange. The first commercial ion-exchange resins removed the common ions found in most water supplies. The prevalent ions in these water supplies are derived from salts of calcium, magnesium and sodium, primarily the bicarbonates, sulfates, chlorides and silica. The following table lists the common ions found in most city waters: TABLE I - Common Ions CATIONS ANIONS Calcium (Ca) Alkalinity (HCO3) Magnesium (Mg) Sulfate (S04) Sodium (Na) Chloride (C1) Silica (SiO2) In the last 50 years there has been large growth and development in many industries, including electroplating, semiconductor and printed circuit board. These industries added new heavy metal contaminants to wastewater, such as copper, nickel, lead, chromium and zinc. In the early years, there was neither information on how to use ion-exchange technology to remove these contaminants, nor was there need. Environmental regulations had not been written and resource recovery did not seem an economical or viable option. Recently, as waste volumes have grown, it has become necessary to remove heavy metals from process effluents. Some of these metals are relatively valuable, making it economical to recover them. During the last 20 years, several new ion-exchange resins have been developed that are selective for heavy metals. Recently, recovery has become widely recognized as a way to reduce waste treatment costs. Ion-exchange resins have different affinities for different ions. These affinities vary with the ion-exchange resin. Since the first commercially available ion-exchange resins removed all the common ions, they had no special affinity for the small amount of the heavy metal ions in process effluents. Special purpose ion-exchange resins are available that have extremely high affinities for particular metal ions, including the heavy metals. These resins attract and hold only the heavy metal ions, while ignoring the common ions, even though they may exist at higher concentrations. For example, a waste stream might contain 200 times as many of the common ions (calcium, magnesium and sodium) as it does heavy metal ions such as copper. A nonselective resin would have to remove 201 ions in order to get one ion of copper. A selective resin would ignore the other 200 and only remove the one copper. There is a difference in performance of the standard cation resin compared with a resin that is highly selective for copper. Most ion-exchange resins have ionic capacities that are equivalent to an equal volume of caustic or acid at a concentration of five to 10 pct. Ion-exchange resins can be regenerated and reused many times. The waste volume created by the regeneration is small compared to the volume of water treated by the resin. The concentrated waste can be recovered or batch treated. The net effect is to concentrate the wastes. In some cases, the resins are not regenerated, but are disposed of for economic reasons. The typical regeneration process requires about 100 gal of water per cu ft of resin (15 bed volumes). The ion-exchange process is optimized when the ratio of regenerated wastewater to the amount of water processed during the service cycle is minimized. In order to get the most out of the ion-exchange process, three steps should be considered: Optimize the wastewater generating process itself to take maximum advantage of the ion-exchange resin. This simply involves some investigative work to determine exactly what is present in the wastewater and where it originated. Most cationic-exchange resins are good at removing most cationic metals; however, the presence of ordinary ions such as calcium or magnesium in the wastewater may compete for exchange sites, causing interference. If calcium or magnesium is present in wastewater, one should find out if it comes from the manufacturing process or the city water. If the calcium or magnesium is from the city water, a simple water softener upstream of the process removes the salts before the water is introduced to the process. The wastewater discharge from the process will only include the contaminating ions and sodium ions from the effluent of the water softener. Sodium ions do not interfere with the removal of most heavy metals by the ordinary cation resins. Develop an optimal operating procedure for the performance of the ion-exchange resin for the specific application. An older plating operation may have a common trench for draining all the rinse tanks. This trench collects the waste rinse water from all plating operations, and, therefore, would have the metals from all of the operations combined. Depending on the total wastewater chemistry, it may be a less expensive process to treat each specific metallic waste separately rather than at once. More important, segregating the waste streams will greatly benefit the recovery effort because of higher purity of the recovered metal. Select the best resin for the specific situation. Resin selection should be based on an accurate wastewater chemistry. For existing wastewater treatment applications, this is simply a matter of submitting samples to a lab. For new applications, calculations must be made to come up with the estimated strength and characteristics of the wastewater discharge. Deionized water is essentially free of cations such as calcium, magnesium, and sodium as well as anions like sulfate, bicarbonate, chloride and silica. Softened water is essentially free of all calcium and magnesium and usually contains less than 500 mg/liter of sodium. Standard industrial-grade strong acid cation resins can select most heavy metals over sodium, but cannot select them over calcium or magnesium. This kind of resin, which is the least expensive, has excellent operating capacities for heavy metals when the raw water going into the process is either softened or demineralized. These resins cost less and are easier to regenerate. Both the pH and wastewater composition play an important role in deciding between various kinds of selective resins. All of these resins have very high affinities for the hydrogen ion. They tend to auto regenerate at a low pH. In some cases the selection of resin type is entirely based on the effect the pH plays in the operating capacity of the deficient types of resins. Selection of the right resin for the job must account for several factors in itself. First, the ultimate destination of the resin should be considered. Will it be used on a onetime basis and then disposed of, or will it be regenerated? In some waste treatment applications, it makes sense to use resin on a sacrificial basis. The metals are concentrated on the resin, which allows operators to discharge the wastewater stream, but also requires proper disposal of the resin. In regenerable applications the resin will be used repeatedly. Regeneration creates a volume of regenerant wastewater that includes the concentrated metals. The metals can be recovered with electrowinning or the regeneration waste can be treated by chemical flocculation and settling. Calculating the concentration of metals in a regenerant waste stream is relatively easy. Divide the total amount of water treated with one cu ft of resin by the amount of water used to regenerate that resin to get the concentration factor. Multiply the concentration factor by the influent concentration of the contaminating ion(s) to get the level of that ion in the regenerant wastewater. For example, if one cu ft of resin treated 2,000 gal of water and it took 100 gal of water to regenerate one cubic foot, 2,000 divided by 100 equals 20. The concentration factor is 20. This number is multiplied by the inlet concentration of the metal being removed. If, for example, one assumes that the metal was copper and it was at a level of two ppm, the concentration factor of 20 multiplied by two equals 40 ppm; therefore, the 100 gal of regenerant wastewater would contain 40 ppm of copper. Closing the loop eliminates any discharge by recycling all of the water. This is common in the plating industry and involves the use of demineralized water for makeup water in rinse tanks. The wastewater from the rinse tanks is recycled back through ion-exchange resins to remove any metals and restore the water to its original demineralized condition. Usually two ion-exchange systems are employed: one demineralizes the influent city water used for makeup of the rinse baths, and the other system treats the wastewater from the rinse baths. The wastewater treatment system would be regenerated separately. The optimum system would include recovery of the metal from the regenerant waste to further improve the economics of the closed-loop system and replaced hazardous waste hauling with the sale of valuable recovered resources. Ion-exchange resins are ideally suited for the removal of ionic contaminants from dilute waste streams. Some streams, especially mixed wastewaters, can contain high levels of dissolved and suspended solids. These streams may require pretreatment before they can be treated by ion-exchange resins. Ion-exchange resins can foul in the presence of suspended solids, oils, greases and some organics. Cleaning rinses that contain detergents or degreasers should not come in contact with the resins. A good rule of thumb is to consider other treatment processes when the total dissolved solids of the wastewater stream approaches 500 to 1,000 ppm.

Faced with the difficult task of removing high-resin, polyurethane paint that had accumulated to one-and-a-half-inches thick on bumper carriers, Midwest Water-blasting Company, Tecumseh, Michigan, turned to ultra-high-pressure equipment. Plant operations at the large automotive plant shut down over a holiday weekend to clean the carriers. Excess build-up of polyurethane paint was interfering with bumper carrier alignment in the paint booth. This caused erroneous computer readings that resulted in misguided robotic paint spray applications. "High-resin polyurethane is a highly elastomeric material. It is one of the toughest paints to remove," commented Al Schafer, president of Midwest Waterblasting Company. "This is some of the roughest work we do, and only ultra-high water pressure can remove this build-up." A total of 370 carriers occupy the conveyor line. Each carrier handles four plastic bumpers. Midwest Waterblasting used Jet Edge Model 36-25OD diesel-powered Intensifier pumps and four Ultra-Lite Lances to do the job. The equipment was set up and ran 62 hrs non-stop. The system was fed by an on-site water supply. Each lance has an 0.027-inch orifice. Both pumps provide the lances with water pressurized to 36,000 psi. The water easily cut through the one-and-a-half-inch thick paint build-up, cleaning the carriers to bare metal. During the cleanup, precise control of water velocity and careful application methods prevented bumper carrier damage. Consistent production required the correct orifice and lance combination, while maintaining the proper standoff distance between lance tip and target material. Because of the nature of ultra-high-pressure waterjet technology, carriers were cleaned without using heat, which eliminated spark ignition or metal fatigue from thermal stress. Use of ultra-high-pressure water also helped eliminate hazardous airborne particles that are inherent with other removal techniques. The practical elimination of contaminants increased operator efficiency without the need for ventilation or containment facilities.

By Gerald A. Crawford, Ph.D. Nickel Development Institute Toronto, Canada Many metals, including nickel, are coming under increasing scrutiny by regulators because of real or alleged effects on the environment and human health. Nickel initially attracted attention because of a greater incidence of lung and nasal cancers among nickel smelter and refinery workers in the early decades of this century. Nickel-containing materials identified with these cancers are nickel oxides and subsulfides and to a lesser extent nickel sulfate. There is no compelling evidence that nickel metal itself causes cancer. Workers are exposed by inhaling airborne particles, which can remain in the lungs for many years. The dusty conditions that existed in early nickel production operations have been eliminated. Today worker exposure is usually within regulated limits. In the 1980's, under the leadership of the world-renowned Sir Richard Doll of Oxford University, an international team of epidemiologists conducted a major epidemiological study of early production operations. The data were ambiguous. The most confounding factor was that most of the workers smoked. The so-called "Doll" study concluded there was no evidence to suggest a health problem from insoluble nickel compounds (oxides and sulfides) at nickel concentrations less than 10 mg/cu meter. It also concluded there was no health problem from soluble nickel compounds (sulfate and chloride) at concentrations less than one mg/cu meter. Most regulated limits today are one tenth of those exposures or less. While some operations occasionally exceed the limits, most are in compliance. Also, there is little evidence today of elevated incidence of lung or nasal cancers among nickel producers or users relative to local populations. Nickel Dermatitis. The other significant health effect of nickel is dermatitis. This is a phenomenon associated with soluble nickel compounds or nickel metal dissolved in sweat that penetrates skin causing an allergic reaction in genetically predisposed individuals. As a workplace exposure, this is probably a greater risk than is lung cancer by inhalation of aerosols of nickel sulfate, chloride or sulfamate. As many as 10-20 pct of women and one to two pct of men are nickel sensitive. It is caused primarily by wearing inexpensive, nickel-plated jewelry. Nickel plating is common in jewelry making, but often the nickel is plated with silver, gold, platinum or other noble metals. Inexpensive jewelry simply stops at the nickel plate, and, thus, nickel metal is in direct contact with the skin. If the contact is long enough for sweat to react with the nickel, the dissolved nickel can cause an allergic reaction. It is important to recognize that it is not nickel metal that is the problem, but rather dissolved nickel. Nickel that is not in contact with the skin long enough to react with sweat is not a problem; nor is nickel in a form that does not react with sweat, such as most stainless steels. While there are problems with inexpensive nickel-plated jewelry, there are seldom problems with stainless steel wrist watches. Concerns in the Plating Industry. Nickel-platers can get dermatitis from skin contact with soluble nickel compounds. They can experience respiratory problems from inhaling airborne aerosols or other nickel-containing particles. The preventive measures are gloves and ventilation and/or masks. Gloves are a better preventive than cure for dermatitis. Once sensitized to nickel, gloves may not eliminate the problem because they enhance the generation of sweat, which encourages dermatitic reactions. Some nickel-sensitized workers have ultimately had to change their work functions to eliminate exposure to soluble nickel. As for respiratory effects, ventilation is preferable to a mask, but the latter is an additional safety feature that minimizes exposure. Exposure Measurement and Data. Nickel exposures in most nickel plating operations are unknown. Most platers feel they simply do not have the resources to measure exposure. Those who do generally buy the service rather than do it themselves. Details of exposure measurement are extensive and can be found in the "Safe Use of Nickel in the Workplace." This is a health guide published in June 1994, as a joint effort of the Nickel Producers Environmental Research Association (NiPERA) and the Nickel Development Institute (NiDi). The guide is a comprehensive reference to the health effects of nickel and its safe use in the workplace. Included in the guide is a description of devices and procedures for measuring exposure to various nickel-containing substances. The data from various nickel plating operations show that while exposures exceed regulated limits in parts of some operations, they are generally lower and in compliance with regulated limits overall. Nickel Exposure Limits. Permissible exposure limits (PELs) are different but similar from one country to another. In the United Kingdom the PEL for nickel metal and all nickel compounds is 0.5 mg/cu meter. There is no distinction made of nickel in various forms. In the U.S. the limits are one mg/cu meter for nickel metal and insoluble nickel compounds and 0.1 mg/cu meter for soluble compounds. U.S. courts required OSHA to rescind the 0.1 mg/cu meter limit because it had been improperly established. Thus the only legally binding PEL for nickel and any of its compounds, except for nickel carbonyl, is one mg/cu meter. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has proposed lower Threshold Limit Values (TLV's) that could be adopted by OSHA in 1997 or thereafter. The initial proposal in 1989 stated that the TLV for nickel and all its compounds should be decreased to 0.05 mg/cu meter. This TLV has been consistently opposed by NiPERA and NiDi. As a result, ACGIH has delayed decision on the matter annually since the original proposal. ACGIH is now thinking of revising its proposed TLV's to 0.5 mg/cu meter for nickel metal, 0.1 mg/cu meter for insoluble nickel compounds and 0.05 mg/cu meter for soluble nickel compounds. While these limits are still unacceptable to industry, they are an improvement over a proposed TLV of 0.05 mg/cu meter for all nickel substances. ACGIH is also likely to propose that nickel and all its compounds be classified as confirmed human carcinogens. Presently this designation applies only to nickel oxides, subsulfides and nickel carbonyl. NiDi and NiPERA feel that, based on the evidence, inclusion of other nickel substances in this category is unjustified. Risk Assessment. The attitude of this proposal is that if a substance is shown to be hazardous, causing problems under certain imposed conditions, then it should be regulated as though it would cause the same problem under any less severe conditions. The industrial, and much of the scientific, community promotes an alternative view that regulation should be risk based. This means that under given conditions an undesirable effect actually does happen, not whether it might happen. As an example: gasoline is a hazardous substance, but its use in automobiles is not a significant risk because it is kept in closed gas tanks. Exposure limits should be set at levels above which it is known there are unacceptable risks, not at lower limits simply because the substance is regarded as hazardous. The most important information for regulating substances is actual exposure and worker health records. If the health records indicate no elevated health effects relative to the surrounding community, then there would seem no reason to regulate exposures below those that have prevailed in practice. This is the position NiDi adopts with regulatory agencies. Wastewaters. In addition to workplace exposures, nickel-platers must also be concerned about emissions of nickel-containing gases to the air; liquids to sewers or drains; and solids to recyclers or landfill. Regulations govern the disposal of aqueous or other effluents to sewers or natural water courses, including nickel. Again, limits vary with jurisdictions and may be more constrained in regions or municipalities than nationally. It is the responsibility of each plater to determine the regulations affecting him. Nickel limits for aqueous effluents presently established by the U.S. EPA are 1.1 mg/liter a day and 0.5 mg/liter a month average. Most plating operations cannot comply directly with effluent wastewater regulations wherever they are. Wastewaters are therefore commonly treated with lime to neutralize and precipitate residual nickel concentrations so that effluents are in compliance. Solid Wastes. Most of the solid wastes generated by platers are precipitates from aqueous effluents. Characteristically, these are relatively small quantities by weight and volume and are accumulated in drums to be picked up at appropriate intervals by recyclers, disposal agencies or both. They assume responsibility for the environmental fate of the waste either by recycling or disposal. Waste for disposal must either meet leachate tests before going to landfill or discarded at higher cost in hazardous waste landfills.

The generator is resistant to hostile environments and cavitational erosion associated with ultrasound. The transducer has no welds or brazing, so there are no stress points or corrosion centers. It is a low-profile unit that is installed easily and suitable for retrofit applications. The Push-Pull ultrasound is generated by opposing piezo-electric transducers mounted on both ends of the titanium bar. The transducers resonate the push-pull assembly, emitting ultrasound radially. This produces a dense, homogeneous sound field. The generators are completely modular. Single source, remote power control can run up to five 1,500-watt modules independently or as one system. Up to 50 pct fewer watts are required to accomplish cleaning. The system is submerged in the cleaning solution and requires no box wall that could impede sound transmission. Generators constantly tune output to the push-pull assemblies. The generators can be run independently through remote control. Source: Surftran Cleaning Systems Group, Sterling Heights, Michigan.

It works as a liaison between the associations and their lobbying organizations and government representatives. Recently, the Government Relations Staff sent out a memo on what has been happening in Washington with certain issues. The industry has been active in the current debate on the Clean Water Act Reauthorization. Industry involvement resulted in passage of House Rule 961 in May, 1995, and efforts continue to have the Senate pass a similar bill. Superfund Reform is among the top items on the congressional agenda for the coming year. House Rule 2500 reflects many of the principles supported by the industry, particularly in cleanup standards. However, changes that repeal retroactive liability at multi-party sites are expected and welcomed. Some representatives have drafted a narrow bill that makes technical corrections to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Issues addressed may include reforms to vehicle inspection maintenance, employee trip reductions, Title V permitting and enhanced or compliance assurance. NAMF has signed an industry letter supporting the legislation. The NAMF has endorsed H.R. 2335, a limited bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to exempt materials reused in industrial processes from the definition of solid waste. The House is expected to vote on this in Spring 1996. Industry is preparing comments on Phase I of the Metal Products and Machinery Effluent Guidelines Proposal (MP&M). Many major industries (aerospace, electronics) and companies provided comments and financial assistance in preparing this commentary. The EPA is considering combining MP&M Phase I and Phase II, which would mean that the rule would take longer to complete. In mid-December 1995, EPA, under pressure from Government Relations, published a five-year deferral and proposal to permanently exempt decorative chromium electroplaters from Clean Air Act Title Vpermitting requirements. OSHAis considering lowering the chromium permissible exposure limit (PEL) from 100 mg/cu meter to 0.5 to 1 mg/cu meter. Government Relations is working with the Chrome Coalition to develop a response strategy. In addition to funding from the Associations, the Government Relations Committee also needs your input and support: supplying data, writing to your representatives, attending hearings, letting the Government Relations Committee know your position on issues.

" Reach for the TOP A perspective on effective pretreatment . . . By Chuck Soule Director Finished Manufacturing Diversey Corp., DuBois Division Cincinnati, Ohio Performance standards for product finishers are getting tougher and tougher. The drive for higher quality has forced many companies to review their approach to pretreatment. During this period of self-reflection, several fundamental issues have been revealed. One such issue is Total Operational Performance (TOP). TOP is the integration and control of all process-related variables to maximize pretreatment results. Broadening the scope of review and control enables one to sustain higher levels of pretreatment performance. This broadened scope includes, but is not limited to, such non-traditional areas as soil management, parts-handling procedures and air blow quality. The following illustrates the concept and benefits of TOP. The initial step in pretreatment is to successfully identify all key operating variables. Often, this involves a detailed review of the system coupled with the monitoring and control of parameters such as pressures, pH, concentrations and temperatures. TOP begins where these leave off, broadening one's perspective and helping improve overall efficiency. While it is critical to identify, isolate and ultimately control the aforementioned variables, it is essential to go beyond this cursory review. A survey of companies indicated that only 20 pct of those polled go beyond this level of performance control. The first step in reaching TOP is to assume a proactive role and conduct a detailed review of all variables involved in the pretreatment process. From the soils introduced as parts are processed, to paint application methods, each variable must be identified, isolated and eventually controlled. The logical place to begin this exercise is the interrelationship of soils and substrates. Soil Management. There are many types of soils. A soil is any contaminant placed on the part as it is processed. There are also many cleaners. The only way to maximize your performance is to select the cleaner chemistry that best suits the soils. While this is generally the goal for chemical selection, all too often a detailed review of soils is not conducted. For example, you may know that you are attempting to remove cutting fluids in your pretreatment process. A more detailed look might provide insight as to whether you are attempting to clean a straight oil, water-soluble oil, synthetic or semi-synthetic fluid. This information is important because each soil presents a different cleaning challenge. For instance, you may choose to use a complex phosphate cleaner for a mineral-oil-type soil versus a heavy caustic formulation. The soils and chemicals selected must be viewed in relation to the substrate. Selecting a heavy-duty alkaline cleaner for processing nonferrous substrates could be disastrous unless adequately inhibited. By working cooperatively with your chemical supplier you can maximize your cleaner selection based on the soil/substrate criteria. Soil management allows you to effectively select cleaner chemistries based on the type of soils encountered. Though this seems logical, soil management is perhaps one of the most neglected facets of effective pretreatment. It is all too common that one assumes, regardless of the soils, the traditional pretreatment process is hearty enough to remove varying soils. While this may be successful, it is more efficient to control what enters the process. A Midwest manufacturer of consumer goods relied on its traditional five-stage pretreatment system to adequately prepare parts prior to painting. Things were working smoothly until one day the parts were no longer getting cleaned. The chemicals were checked, as was the entire washer setup. Nothing in the system was out of specification. To eliminate the new cleaning problem, extensive time was spent attempting to resolve the problem chemically. After thorough review, the company determined the culprit was a change in the soils. A new stamping fluid was being tested that was different in nature than the previous soils. If this issue had been communicated beforehand and pretested for ease of cleaning, the cleaning problem could have been avoided. Effective soil management could have saved both time and money. The fundamentals of soil management are simple. Simply stated, you need to know what types of soils are on the substrates and how to remove them. Work with suppliers to identify, document and communicate soil types and changes. Work with your chemical supplier to ensure that the soils can be easily cleaned with the selected chemistry. The place for testing for soil removal is the laboratory, not your plant. Work with the supplier of the various soils to ensure you have the right product for the application. Where possible, seek to reduce and/or consolidate the soils. Ensure any and all changes to incoming soils are effectively communicated and controlled. Develop a history for fluctuations in soil loading characteristics. Through effective soil management and continuing through effective parameter control, you begin building a solid pretreatment system. It is not enough to rely on your spray wash system to deliver the quality you desire. Quality can only come through complete review and control of all the upstream and downstream processes that lead to your traditional pretreatment system. Figure 1 pinpoints other areas for review. The implementation of TOP also includes enhancements to your traditional pretreatment system components. The traditional view of the pretreatment system consists of those items both chemical and mechanical that are used to prepare parts prior to painting. Water quality. If one seeks to enhance the performance within the confines of the traditional pretreatment system, one must begin with water quality. The rinse water quality is extremely important for enhanced pretreatment performance. Consult your chemical supplier about your water quality and its impact on your pretreatment system. Cleaning chemicals. The next area of consideration should be the selection, use and control of the chemistries chosen. The premise behind TOP is a complete integration of products and processes. The results generated from any pretreatment system are only going to be as good as the system itself. Therefore, to maximize the performance of the traditional system one must harness the synergy between the chemicals and mechanics. This approach is vital to long term success. Three basic steps to effective systems management include: Determine the goal of the process. Qualify and quantify results. Identify and document rela-tionships between key operating parameters. Minimize variation in key operating parameters. If these steps are followed, one can expect to achieve improved results consistently. Total Operational Performance offers a new perspective on effective pretreatment. If your goal is to continually improve your pretreatment process, you must identify, isolate and ultimately control all the process related variables. The days of concentrating solely on the phosphating system are over. Improved performance begins by reviewing the raw stock as it enters the plant and does not end until final shipment. TOP is the bridge that links these seemingly unlimited variables together and is a proven perspective for consistently achieving your desired pretreatment results. As you evaluate your pretreatment system do not be afraid to reach for the TOP _ Total Operational Performance.

By Jeffrey J. Oravitz Product Manager PPG Industries, Inc. Springdale, Pennsylvania Electrocoating is a widely used technology that has provided excellent levels of performance on a diverse assortment of industrial metal objects for more than 30 years. Electrocoat technology has evolved dramatically since the early 1960's, when it was first commercialized as an automobile body primer. Today, more than 98 pct of all car bodies produced globally use an electrocoat primer. New end uses for electrocoat are found annually, for example: automotive parts and accessories; appliances; heat exchangers; decorative plated objects; and heat-sensitive components. Current commercially available electrocoat systems use processes and materials that are both environmentally friendly and economically efficient. Electrocoat is an "environomic" coating solution for many finishing needs. Major advantages of the electrocoat process include: Total coverage of complex parts with film uniformity Material transfer efficiencies routinely in the 95 to 99 pct range Highly automated, closed-loop systems with excellent productivity and low operating costs Fast line speeds and high part-racking densities Low air and wastewater emissions Totally enclosed systems leading to cleaner and safer paint operations Electrocoat products can be segmented into anodic or cathodic, and epoxy or acrylic. Table I illustrates common end uses for the four categories of electrocoat. The industry's research and development activities have fostered many exciting developments during the past 30 years. Some of the significant advancements include: Environmentally optimized operating processes Near zero VOC and HAPS electrocoat and pretreatment products Lead-free cathodic electrocoat with corrosion protection equal to prior leaded products Cathodic acrylic coatings with corrosion and UV protection as a single-coat finish Two-coat electrocoat systems for ultimate primer/topcoat performance Exceptional coverage of sharp metal edges Advances in material handling and application equipment. The environmental impact of electrocoat is, in many cases, substantially less than that of other coating processes. Transfer efficiency typically exceeds 90 pct with electrocoat, a performance that is difficult to match with liquid or powder spray methods. Closed-loop rinsing and recovery of dragout with little or no permeate to drain greatly reduces wastewater emissions and BOD/COD levels. Conductivity can be controlled easily in both anodic and cathodic systems using automated equipment. The pretreatment processes continue to evolve into more environmentally friendly applications. Better equipment design and improved chemicals are leading to minimized waste treatment demands, elimination of heavy metals and optimized water use without sacrificing performance. New electrocoat products offer the end user a variety of options to meet increasingly stringent air, water and waste disposal regulations. HAPS-free electrocoat products, both anodic and cathodic, are available today. Near-zero-VOC systems are also available, with volatile content as low as 0.1 lb/gal or less. Several systems have demonstrated the ability to operate without solvent additions to the electrocoat tank. Today, a major area of product development is lead-free cathodic epoxy electrocoat. Until now, lead-free electrocoats were not able to offer the same performance as leaded coatings, particularly over substrates without optimal pretreatment. The latest generation of lead-free cathodic epoxy offers the same performance as the prior leaded coatings and is approved by the domestic automotive manufacturers for use on small parts. Cathodic acrylic electrocoats are capable of providing the best combination of corrosion resistance, exterior durability and color control. The appliance market is experiencing the commercialization of single-coat white cathodic acrylic to replace previous applications of primer and topcoat, leading to economic advantages for the end user. New low-VOC and HAPS-free acrylics are in the marketplace, targeted at high-performance applications with improved environmental characteristics. An exciting recent development is the use of the two-coat electrocoat process for extreme performance environments. The first coat is a conductive epoxy electrocoat, which, when baked, provides a surface that can receive a second coat of acrylic electrocoat. The two-coat system is capable of providing long-term exterior durability and corrosion resistance in excess of 2,000 salt spray hours. The photographs represent a current two-coat electrocoat application. With the tendency of coatings to flow away from sharp edges while still in the liquid phase, corrosion protection of objects such as body panel edges and fins on radiators has proven difficult. Advances in cathodic epoxy electrocoat formulations have resulted in the ability to control film thickness over sharp objects, greatly enhancing corrosion resistance. Developments in material handling systems continue to lead to more efficient line designs and less capital cost intensity. A variety of system layouts is available for consideration, including monorail and programmable hoist options. Flexible conveyors provide more efficient use of space with monorail designs. Material handling system suppliers continue to work towards improving the economics associated with electro-coat operations. The use of the electrocoat process to provide excellent coating finishes over a variety of metal surfaces has been widely recognized during the past 30 years. Significant advancements in both anodic and cathodic electrocoat technologies have generated a palette of coating products that are both environmentally friendly and economically efficient. Electro-coat has become the "environomic" coating solution of choice for many product end uses today and future developments to increase the added value nature of electrocoating are in process.

Electrodeposition has been the dominant primer finish through-out the world. Significant advantages of electrocoat over other application methods include film uniformity, improved appearance and quality, complete coverage of complex geometries, high transfer efficiencies, high throughputs due to automation, reduced air and wastewater emissions and reduced fire hazards. A summary of the evolution in the development of cathodic electrodeposition technology is as follows: First Generation, 1976, Corrosion Protection Fourth Generation, 1986, Reduced Film Shrinkage and VOCs Fifth Generation, 1991, Improved throwing power Seventh Generation, 1995, HAPS-free, reduced VOCs, heavy-metal free, low film build. The first generation material has been the workhorse of the automotive parts and accessories (APA) market because it has been considered the "best performance" primer. Although the best performer, it has relatively high VOCs and lead and chrome content compared to the others. The development of future generations was targeted to improve specific undesirables of the original (high VOCs and heavy metals, film shrinkage, better ultrafiltration). In comparison, fourth and fifth generations have been the most used in the automotive OEM market. Metokote Corporation currently has 37 electrodeposition systems, of which 28 are black cathodic epoxies. Started in 1969 in Lima, Ohio, MetoKote presently operates 17 plants in eight states. We specialize in applying protective coatings on parts for the automotive and other industries. Our services include electrodeposition, powder, wet paint and plating. We electrocoat more than 250,000,000 sq ft/year for our more than 500 customers. We have been using first generation electrocoating since 1982. We use or have used the fourth and fifth generation cathodic epoxies and other electrodeposition systems. One of our biggest challenges was to get approval from OEMs and other customers to change the first generation cathodic epoxy tanks to the newer, lead- and chrome-free generations. Our customers were almost always hesitant to change because corrosion performance was never comparable to the first generation coating at extended salt spray hours. Increased film builds and appearance changes (gloss level) have also been a problem for many customers. In 1993, MetoKote was facing 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and consequently Title V regulations with permitting thresholds of 10 tons for any particular HAP and 25 tons for total combined HAPS. We were in the process of developing a strategy to minimize the business impact of Title V permitting and realized that existing electrocoat technologies would not get us below the thresholds in plants with multiple lines. Our primary strategy was to ask the coating manufacturer to develop an electrocoating that had no VOCs, HAPS or heavy metals. And to make it even tougher, we requested a coating that exhibited performance comparable to that of the original cathodic epoxy at low film builds. As a good partner and supplier, the manufacturer accepted the challenge and in 18 months seventh generation cathodic epoxy was available and approved for a production trial. MetoKote filled the first and only R&D/trial/production line in May 1995. Our goal now is to convert all 28 tanks before the summer of 1996. Our "mission" is to quickly change as many tanks to the seventh generation material as possible. Environmental Considerations. Solvent/VOCs. The seventh generation system has been formulated with low solvent/VOCs. The resin has significantly less solvent than the first generation resin, but virtually the same as the fourth and fifth generation resins. The paste for the latest material has about half the amount of solvent as paste for the earlier coatings. Figure 1 shows the solvent/VOC content of seventh generation coatings. The real environmental benefit hinges not on the coating's solvent/VOC content but on actual solvent/VOC emissions. Emission reduction is more striking when film weight loss in the oven, film build and solvent replenishment are taken into consideration (Figure 2) . HAPS. The seventh generation system has zero HAPS (Figure 3). A major improvement of the resin as compared to earlier resins is the zero HAPS released during the curing process. Although some solvents are released during the crosslinking process they are not listed HAPS. In addition, the paste corresponding to the seventh generation resin is HAPS free. Heavy Metals. The seventh generation system is both chrome and lead-free (Figure 4). It is the first cathodic epoxy electrocoat to exhibit excellent performance at low film builds without using heavy metals. Currently fourth and fifth generation systems can be used without heavy metals but the lack of extreme performance at low film builds has forced many users to apply films greater than one mil. Even at high film builds extreme performance is not equivalent to the same materials when pastes containing lead and chrome are used. Although electrocoat is known for high transfer efficiencies (95 pct plus) and closed-loop arrangements with the use of ultrafiltration units, some paint is always depleted from the system due to replacement of bag filters, periodic maintenance of the bath to eliminate sludge accumulated in the bottom of tank (especially if agitation is not adequate), carryover to final post rinse tank and accidental spills. These wastes are regulated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) or the Clean Water Act (CWA). In an electrocoat system that uses a no chrome or lead paint, any waste that needs to be disposed of off-site most likely will be classified as non-hazardous. This results in less regulatory burden on the user and lower disposal and liability costs. Additionally, the discharge of the final post rinse overflow (if deionized water) could be made to the local sewer system after pH adjustment, instead of going to wastewater treatment. Application Considerations. The seventh generation system has introduced several operating or application differences as compared to previous generations of electrocoats (Figure 5). Percent solids and P/B (pigment/binder) ratios are virtually the same as fourth and fifth generation systems but much lower than the first generation system. Conductivity and pH are slightly lower than all prior generations. Bath temperature is maintained slightly higher than prior generations. Operating range is 90-100F with optimum at 92-93F. This higher temperature actually reduces the cooling load on the chilling equipment, which translates into lower operating costs. Cure temperature is slightly higher than prior generations. While earlier systems can develop good properties at metal temperatures of 350F for 20 min, the seventh generation system requires at least 375F metal temperature for 20 min to develop comparable properties. The amount of permeate to drain in a seventh generation system has been found to be lower than a first generation system, but virtually equal to fourth and fifth generation systems. This translates into lower operating costs by minimizing the amount of wastewater going into in-house wastewater treatment systems. Oven fouling in a seventh generation system has also greatly improved over prior generations. Oven fouling is the amount of chemical released from the curing film that accumulates on internal oven surfaces. These deposits, if not cleaned periodically, can dislodge from the oven walls and end up on the work pieces. Oven fouling has been reduced primarily by formulating the latest system with less solvent and by minimizing the amount of film shrinkage. (Figure 6). The material's increased coulombic efficiencies of the material over prior generations are significant. Earlier systems needed a minimum of 150 volts to properly coat, whereas the latest system coats at voltages of 100 volts or less. This is unusual considering the paint bath conductivity is slightly lower than prior generations. Electrical efficiency of the latest system is approximately 1.2-1.7 amps/sq ft. In the earlier systems it is 2.0-2.5 amps/sq ft. The higher electrical efficiency of the seventh generation system translates into lower electrical consumption, smaller rectification units and lower waste heat going into the paint bath. The throwing power for the seventh generation system has also improved. Throwing power is the ability to coat in hard-to-reach areas. The latest system has greater throwing power than originally thought. It surpassed the fifth generation system with a throwing power of 16-18 inches. This could be explained by the higher electrical efficiency of the latest system and its ability to deposit film quickly. Edge coverage of the seventh generation system has also improved. Edge coverage is the ability of a curing film to not flow away from peaks in the substrate and leave a film of lower thickness than the average that could lead to premature corrosion failures. This is critical on castings or forgings with high profile surfaces. Testing has shown older generations with 75-100 rust spots (GM 9632P, 38 deg), whereas the new system shows about 45 rust spots at a 0.15 P/B ratio. Film weight loss in the oven, also known as shrinkage, has greatly improved (Figure 6). Film weight loss occurs in the oven during crosslinking. Less shrinkage translates into lower material consumption and therefore less material cost. Film weight losses as low as one pct at 400F have been reported. Seventh generation cathodic epoxy represents the latest generation in an evolutionary chain of technology that extends back more than 30 years. It is an electrocoating system built around the requirements of a custom coater. It is fully approved under small parts specifications for Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. It meets requirements at low film thickness (12-20 microns) over properly zinc phosphated substrates. It is a heavy-metal free, HAPS-free, low-VOC and solvent-free operation. It has no solvent-replenishment costs, reduced wastewater treatment costs, zero hazardous waste generation and higher transfer efficiencies. Seventh generation is the only available electrocoat technology that meets the performance, environmental and operating costs of the present and future automotive parts market.

By Emilie Pazdan Roy Metal Finishing Company Conestee, South Carolina When Donald and Cecile Roy began Roy Metal Finishing (RMF) more than three decades ago, their dream was to establish a successful plating company dedicated to superior quality and attentive customer service. They did just that. Today, RMF is approaching its 35th year with more than 40 employees, a 49,000-sq-ft facility and many satisfied customers throughout the Southeast. These factors are quite a contrast from those of the beginning: three employees, 1,200-sq-ft facility and one satisfied customer. Although many changes have occurred at RMF throughout the years, one fact has remained constant, superior quality and attentive customer service. This objective is maintained today with the second generation leadership of President Clifford Roy. RMF first provided hard chromium plating on parts for the textile industry. As years passed, the company survived by doing any plating job, thus requiring management to diversify into cadmium, zinc, copper, brass, nickel chromium plating and polishing. The diversity did not last long, however. With the "help" of the Clean Water Act in the 70's, RMF decided to eliminate all cyanides, therefore reducing the company's finishes to zinc, zinc phosphate, nickel and nickel chromium. In 1976, a complete waste treatment system was designed and installed to meet all federal and state regulations. As such regulations became more strict, RMF also eliminated hard chromium plating. RMF chose to concentrate on high-volume zinc chloride plating, and chose Frederick Gumm Chemical Company as its zinc supplier. The new focus expanded the company's plating diversification. It engineers plating using zinc on steel with clear, iridescent or olive drab chromates from MacDermid, or black chromates from Gumm. At this point, no job was too small. RMF stopped plating zinc for simple coverage and began giving customers zinc-plated parts engineered to their specifications. In the 1980's, the American automotive industry began to take a beating at the hands of foreign competition. RMF saw this coming and took measures to protect the company. Because plating specifications would become more stringent, RMF made large investments in bigger machines that were able to plate thicker deposits while maintaining high production. The old Udylite VIP machines were scrapped and Jessup barrel zinc and barrel zinc-phosphate machines were purchased. The machines' programmed hoists provided the versatility needed for changing plating requirements. In addition to improving the design of its machines, the company also updated its laboratory, which allowed for monitoring the plating line through SPC data. Customers also benefited from the addition of thickness measuring devices, automatic pH controllers, amp/hr brightener feeders, chromate feeders, constant voltage/amp rectifiers, plating bath filters, recirculating pumps in rinse tanks, digital scales for loading, automatic soak and electrocleaner controls as well as an atmospheric evaporator. Plating certifications are typical requirements of the automotive industry today. To meet these requirements, several eddy current thickness instruments are used to measure thickness near the production lines. The most recent purchase was an x-ray fluorescence machine from CMI International that gives the most accurate readings. In addition, a salt spray cabinet is used to ensure that plated parts meet the standards currently required by all automotive and industrial accounts. It is no longer acceptable to have 48 and 96 hrs to red corrosion. Parts plated at RMF survive 146 and 250 hrs salt spray to red rust because of topcoats applied over the zinc plate. The vast improvements of the 1980's and early 1990's have led RMF to many successful undertakings. Today, the company builds its own rack and barrel machines. It has five automatic barrel plating lines and three automatic rack lines. These lines enable the company to meet the 24-hr turnaround demanded by many of its customers. The research and development department has also developed its own pilot lines for zinc-iron and tin-zinc alloy finishes, designed to increase corrosion protection in excess of 250 salt spray hrs. As it grows, the company will have the technical knowledge available for the development of new production lines. Through a tightly controlled environment, RMF can give the automotive industry the quality it needs. But the staff makes all the difference. All staff members have been carefully trained and each production supervisor has at least 12 years of in-house experience. Several employees, including one supervisor, have more than 18 years of service with the company. The staff works hard to satisfy the customer, including daily communication concerning their jobs. To keep RMF in the running as an industry leader, it takes a different drive. With its modern plant facilities, advanced plating machines, great people and the flexibility to diversify for the next century, Roy Metal Finishing exceeds and excels.

In the fall of 1994, Alan Whittemore walked into Teknicote Inc. and started asking a lot of questions. "It was an intriguing meeting," noted Judy Catalon, vice president of sales and administration for Teknicote, Central Falls, Rhode Island. "And it was basically one-sided." The customer asked about the company's history in powder coating, its techniques and results. However, he never gave any details about his product. "Usually, when we meet with potential customers, it is an exchange. We ask a lot of questions about the product in question so that we can explain the best process for the project and also to make sure we are the right company for the job," explained Ms. Catalon. It was not until Teknicote signed a confidentiality agreement that Mr. Whittemore, president of Heliotrope, felt comfortable disclosing the details. Heliotrope, a limited liability company headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island, designs high-end outdoor furniture using aluminum and stainless steel components. It was founded in August 1993, by Gary Wolf of Boston-based Gary Wolf Architects, Inc. and Alan Whittemore, a Rhode Island real estate developer and former client of Mr. Wolf's. When Heliotrope first opened its doors, it had one product, a hammock, called the ZephyrTM. "The inspiration for developing the hammock came from a black and white photocopied image of a tiny bent-chipboard model I had made," said Mr. Wolf. "The image of a serpentine frame combined with my own experience with hammocks from my childhood was really the springboard for the product design." The traditional hammock's lack of durability was a key issue in terms of materials and finishes. Painted steel hammock frames eventually rust, peel and crack. Weather tends to deteriorate wooden-frame hammocks. With these issues in mind, Messrs. Wolf and Whittemore drew up basic guidelines to help them create a better hammock. In addition to a new form, the hammock had to be truly weather resistant. It also had to provide the potential to replace only the fabric bed instead of the whole hammock. The frame had to securely mount to a base (as an option), and the fixed frame had to have the ability to rotate in place. It took one year to develop the Zephyr hammock from design, to manufacture to packaging. Within that year, Mr. Whittemore traveled throughout the country searching for the best companies to manufacture and complete the product. "I sat down with hundreds of vendors in all the industries, and for powder coating, all roads in New England led to Teknicote," said Mr. Whittemore. "In the beginning, we investigated resin transfer molding for the frame," added Mr. Wolf. "We finally chose powder coating on aluminum extrusions instead because it is the material of preference for contemporary products at the upper end of the market. Aluminum is durable, strong, lightweight and recyclable, and powder coating is an environmentally friendly finishing process." Teknicote powder coats the hammock's aluminum frame with a white polyester specifically used for outdoor applications. It withstands ultraviolet rays, extreme heat and cold. The finish not only benefits the product due to its durability, but adds a sophisticated, modern appeal. Heliotrope unveiled the Zephyr hammock prototype at the Chicago Casual Furniture Trade Show in September '94. When Heliotrope selected Teknicote as its powder coater, the product was still undergoing fine-tuning. Teknicote powder coated dozens of samples by hand. "We have a customer-driven operation," said Alan Nathan, part-owner of Teknicote. "To me, the definition of such a company is to have the product ready when the customer wants it, not when we can finish it." That is why company profits are used to install more equipment, update existing systems and improve service. Teknicote has five hand-operated lines and six automatic ones. "If necessary, we can run the same product on two lines to meet a deadline," said Mr. Nathan. "In addition, because we are a large operation, we can run the parts in half a dozen places so we are rarely backlogged." Teknicote has two sites, one in Central Falls and one in Cumberland, Rhode Island. The Cumberland plant has three automatic lines that are used primarily for high-volume, large and small parts. The Central Falls operation has three automated lines that handle low-volume parts requiring high-quality and high-tech plastic coatings. This is where the Heliotrope sample parts were coated. Once the shape of the Zephyr frame was finalized, it was put on an automatic line in Cumberland. When the aluminum frames arrive at Teknicote they are first cleaned in an acidic cleaner that also lightly etches the surface. After rinsing, parts enter a second cleaner to remove any smut. Once rinsed, the pieces receive a chromate conversion coating. After rinsing, parts are sealed to close and neutralize any gaps in the conversion coating. Cleaners and conversion coatings are from Dubois Division of Diversey Corp., Cincinnati, Ohio. Parts are then run through a convection oven to dry, after which the frames are ready for powder coating. Powders are applied using electrostatic spray. Teknicote uses powder coatings from a number of suppliers, including O'Brien Powder Products, Protech Chemicals and Morton International. Technique also plays a part in the process. Inherent in the procedure are high-current density areas that prevent proper coverage without the right equipment and expert sprayers. Automatic lines from Gema, Indianapolis, Indiana, have fixed and oscillating guns in addition to hand spray booths. "Our state-of-the-art equipment allows us to coat pieces with a precise, even thickness, which is usually hard to attain," said Mr. Barthelemy, vice president of production and engineering. "We are also successful at coating selective areas of a piece regardless of complexity." Part of Teknicote's operation that Heliotrope found attractive was its environmentally safe process. "At Teknicote, we are environmentally conscious," said Mr. Barthelemy. "All wastewater from the cleaning process is run through a pretreatment system from which approximately 50 pct of the water is recycled. We also recycle the powder." While Teknicote is in compliance with current environmental regulations, the company's goal is to recycle all of its water to reach zero discharge. "Not only are our facility and equipment first rate, but our staff is equally as impressive," said Mr. Nathan. "The three middle managers who run the day-to-day operations in Cumberland and Central Falls and our quality control system have been with the company since it opened in 1972." For quality control, Teknicote employs in-process inspectors, roving inspectors and a quality control lab that tests durability, thickness and adhesion, among other parameters. "Not one of our pieces ever came back with orange peel," said Mr. Whittemore. "And every part was wrapped for protection." Heliotrope has received national recognition for the Zephyr hammock design and Messrs. Wolf and Whittemore attribute part of its success to Teknicote's work. The Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design awarded the Zephyr one of its Distinguished Product Awards last year in its "Good Design--Made in the USA" product design competition. The American Society of Interior Designers gave the Zephyr hammock one of five First Place Design Awards for 1994. And, Heliotrope received the IDSA/Business Week Industrial Design Excellence Award. The Zephyr hammock has appeared on the cover of Innovation magazine, the quarterly journal of the Industrial Designers Society of America. It also made Time magazine's top ten best products list of 1994. Heliotrope is currently working on a less expensive curvilinear steel hammock frame and is also designing other outdoor furniture, including lighting, seating, tables, and sun and wind screens. Teknicote will be there to assist the company in its future endeavors.

TR, Products Finishing's publisher and editorial director has retired. He joined Products Finishing when I was five years old. Little did I know as I skipped off to kindergarten that my future teacher was beginning his learning experience in the world of finishing and publishing. Tom's first true love is the game of golf. Appropriately, the July 1967 (his first month with the magazine) cover of Products Finishing featured golf clubs. The article, by then editor, Ezra Blount, discussed black chromium plating and colorizing golf club heads. Tom's first article appeared one year later, in the July 1968 issue. The cover, inappropriately, was a lawn mower. The article, "Finishing Homko Equipment at AMF Western Tool," covered automatic replenishment of pre-paint chemicals as well as the complete paint finishing line at the lawn mower manufacturer, which was in Tom's home state of Iowa. Tom started as an assistant editor for the magazine. During the past 29 years he worked his way through the ranks to the role of publisher/editorial director. Now, with the history aside, I would like to tell you about the Tom Robison I know. He is one of the most intelligent individuals I have ever met. There were few instances where he could not answer one of my questions on finishing. He honed my writing ability and taught me how to focus on what was important to the finishing industry. He enjoyed a good party. And could be found at PF cocktail parties wearing a silly hat and sporting a boyish grin. He loved golf. He golfed with finishers, suppliers and others in the industry. He has played Pebble Beach, Augusta and other famous courses. If Tom was not in the office, he was probably golfing. He is Caring, but not doting; Enlightening, but not preachy; Retired, but not forgotten. I will greatly miss my mentor.

By Joseph T. Menke Chemical Engineer U.S. Army Rock Island, Illinois PART II (continued from September, 1996) This is the second part of a three-part series of articles on zinc phosphate coatings. It characterizes various zinc phosphate coatings on zinc-plated or galvanized substrates. Dip and spray processes with and without grain refinement were used to coat the substrates. Calcium-modified (dip only), manganese-modified (dip and spray) and nickel-fluoride (spray only) formulations were used. Standard four by six ft or four by 12-inch panels coated with electro-deposited zinc or galvanized (G60 or G90) coatings were used in this study. Various phosphate coating chemical suppliers applied the coatings using the formulations described above. The phosphated panels were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) at 500X. Photos were taken to illustrate crystal structure and coating coverage. Testing was also performed to determine the phosphate coating weight. X-ray analyses on the SEM were also performed. Part one of this series showed calcium-modified coatings on zinc plating with much higher coating weights (1). The proprietary solution used in that study was different and produced coating weights in the 700-1,000 mg/ft range without grain refinement and 600-800 mg/ft with grain refinement. The coatings in the previous report were applied at 180 to 200F, while the coatings in this study were applied at 145 to 155F. This temperature variation could be responsible for the lower coating weights observed in this study. The first series of phosphate cootings to be evaluated were applied with immersion calcium-modified solutions. Since few spray calcium-modified solutions exist, only the immersion process was used for this test. View First Series' Photos The large crystal structure and high coating weights observed on the galvanized substrates indicate that the calcium-modified solutions are not effective in controlling the grain size or coating weight. The calcium containing crystals (nodules) on the galvanized substrate (figure 3) appear to have formed after the large zinc phosphate platelets were already present. Both zinc-plated and galvanized substrates yield higher coating weights than steel in the same solution. This is due to the higher reactivity of zinc surfaces in the phosphating solution. Rapid dissolution of the zinc metal saturates the phosphating solution with zinc ions that deposit on the surface before the calcium chemicals start any type of crystal refinement. Use of the titanium grain-refinement treatment also controls the crystal structure more predominately than the calcium chemicals in the phosphating solution. A previous paper showed that abrasive blasting on steel provided sufficient surface activity to prevent the formation of calcium-modified zinc phosphate nodules(2). The calcium chemicals in the zinc phosphate solution appeared ineffective for controlling coating weight or crystal structure on zinc substrates. Titanium grain-refinement appeared ineffective on the galvanized surface using calcium-modified solutions. The federal specification for lightweight phosphate coatings (TT-C-490) requires coating weights to be in the 150-500 mg/ft range. Coating weights for the calcium-modified formulations ranged from 359 to 1,350 mg/ft with large variations in crystal structure. Immersion calcium-modified solutions are not suitable for depositing satisfactory zinc phosphate coatings on zinc-plated or galvanized surfaces. The second series of coatings evaluated were applied with immersion or spray manganese-modified zinc phosphate solutions. Crystal size, with and without grain refinement, was consistent for both the spray and immersion processes along with complete coverage of the substrate. The grain refinement dip consistently provided finer crystalline structures and lower coating weights. View Second Series' Photos The manganese-modified zinc phosphate coatings(3). showed consistent coating weights and crystal structures for spray and immersion coatings on zinc-plated and galvanized surfaces. The effect of grain refinement prior to phosphating significantly reduced the coating weight and grain size for both spray and immersion deposits. The manganese shows up in the x-ray analysis of the manganese-modified zinc phosphate coatings similar to calcium in the x-ray analysis of the calcium-modified zinc phosphate nodules. When a grain-refinement dip was used, the manganese still showed up in the x-ray analysis of the phosphate coating, unlike the calcium-modified coatings where the calcium disappeared from the x-ray analysis of the coating. This implies that the manganese in a manganese-modified solution is more effectively incorporated into the crystal structure than calcium is in a calcium-modified solution. The immersion phosphating lasted two min, and the spray phosphating was one min. Yet the coating weights were higher for the spray applied coatings. This is different from phosphate coatings on steel where immersion coatings normally have a higher coating weight than spray coatings. It should also be noted that most manganese-modified zinc phosphate solutions also contain some fluoride and nickel or cobalt ions. However, the fluoride and nickel do not show up in the x-ray analysis of these coatings. No solutions using cobalt were used so the presence of cobalt in the surface crystals is undetermined. The manganese-modified zinc phosphate solutions provided acceptable coatings on zinc-plated and galvanized surfaces. The nickel-fluoride zinc phosphate sprayed on zinc plating and galvanized surfaces showed up as large, flat platelets on both surfaces. Incomplete coverage was noted on the galvanized substrate processed without a grain-refinement dip. Using the grain-refinement dip prior to phosphating significantly reduced the size of the crystals on both surfaces and improved the coverage on the galvanized surface. Use of a grain-refinement dip also significantly reduced the coating weight. According to Rausch (4), the fluoride assists in keeping the galvanize active (minimizes passivation) so that areas that contain impurities (aluminum and lead) can be uniformly phosphate coated along with the zinc. Mr. Rausch also states that fine-grained galvanize is more amenable to phosphating than those with coarser crystalline structures. In the latter case, some crystal facets are uniformly phosphated while others behave as if they were completely passivated. Galvanizing treatments of chromate and silicate may also induce passivation. The previous paper described a phosphate coating on cyanide zinc plating where passivation had occurred with resulting poor coverage. In that case a nickel-chlorate zinc phosphate solution was used in an attempt to form a coating. A grain-refinement dip had to be used to get coverage with the Ni-chlorate solution. The Third series of coatings evaluated were applied by spraying with nickel-flouride zinc phosphate solutions. Coverage varied with substrate material and grain refinement resulted in lower coating weights. A summary of all the coating weights and approximate coverage is included in Tables I and II: TABLE I -- Coating Weight and Coverage on Zinc Plated Substrates IMMERSION SPRAY PHOSPHATE w/o G.R. w/ G.R. w/o G.R. w/ G.R.

Freeman states that for galvanize surfaces, fluoride is used to activate the surface and complex any dissolved aluminum from the surface that could poison the phosphating solution (5). The nickel-fluoride zinc phosphate applied by spraying provided acceptable coatings when a titanium grain refiner was incorporated into the procedure. Various types of zinc phosphating solutions can produce a variety of grain sizes, crystal structures, coating weights and coverage on zinc-plated and galvanized surfaces. Of the nine specifications listed in a previous article for light phosphate coatings (6), only the German specification identified the four different formulations that are the basis for the current state-of-the-art in phosphate coating technology. The ISO specification, which has subsequently been published and is a take-off on the German phosphating specification, also lists the four different formulation types. Since the light phosphate coating is normally a pretreatment for subsequent coatings, the engineer and the applicator must know the type of crystal structure and solution chemistries necessary to ensure the function of those coatings. Often the engineer is only familiar with the specification and not the optimum phosphate solution/coating for a specific application. The applicator, on the other hand, knows what the process is capable of but is not knowledgeable as to the engineering function. The result is often the proverbially right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing, which results in a lot of bad feelings and poor product. The applicator and the engineer need to communicate so that the final product is something that both can be proud of and meets the functional requirements of the customer.

Conventional conversion coatings are applied to steel and zinc-coated steels to inhibit corrosion and provide an effective bond with paints, lacquers and other topcoats. Recent advances in pretreatment have been limited to conversion coatings contrived from solutions containing a minimum of three metal cations. In each of these solutions, the crystalline structure, morphology, density and composition produce an anchor-like barrier that promotes adhesion. Smaller, tighter conversion coatings provide the best adhesion and corrosion resistance. A new approach from Man-Gill Chemical Co., Cleveland, Ohio, involves preparing a metal surface for paint by bonding a reactive organic conversion coating, ROCC, to the metal substrate. The coating serves a dual function by creating a conversion coating on the metal substrate and by reacting with the organic topcoat. The result is a continuous film that prevents the oxygen migration that can occur under paint films, which can cause hydroxyl-induced corrosion, poor salt-fog resistance and lack of adhesion. This ultra-thin, functional organic coating has a molecular layer of 50 to 300 nanometers deep with a total coating weight of 30 to 60 mg per sq ft. The non-metal conversion coating produces a pleasing optical appearance that ranges from a uniform blue to purple. Reactive organic coatings are complex. They have proven to be an excellent pretreatment for steel and galvanized substrates. Work is in progress to evaluate their use on non-ferrous surfaces. The ROCC application process is adaptable to most pretreatment operations without any modifications. It can be applied by both spray and immersion. The product contains no heavy metals, is easily treated using conventional waste treatment, contains biodegradable organic components and results in reduced worker exposure to hazardous chemicals.

By Beverly A. Graves Editor Does an attractive working environment foster production? Steelcase Inc., Grand Rapids, Michigan, thinks so. That is why this 83-year-old company isdedicated tomaking office furniture not only attractive, but durable, functional andenvironmentally compatible. "As a high-performance company, we are committed to continuousenvironmentalimprovements," stated Steve Martin, manager of finishing technology. Onemajortransition was from liquid coating to powder. However, Steelcase did notconvertall its liquid finishing to powder. Steelcase began investigating powder coatings and systems in 1992 aspart ofits long-term strategy for compliance with Clean Air Act requirements. Inorderfor the powder coating system to be cost efficient, a durable coatingwould haveto be applied at 1.5 mils on casegood and systems products. Casegoodproductsinclude file drawers and bins, which receive much wear. First the company tested a number of powder coatings and eventuallyselectedcoatings from Enviro Powder in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Evtech inCharlotte,North Carolina. Once powder coatings were chosen, Steelcase worked withequipmentsuppliers to determine if the coating could be applied to itsspecifications.Several equipment suppliers were evaluated in field tests. Steelcase installed its first Nordson powder coating system in its PanelPlant.The second system went into the Chair II Plant. The third, and mostinvolved,system was installed in the fall of 1994 at the Systems I plant wherecasegoodproducts are made. A fourth system is now coming on-line in thecompany's FilePlant. Each plant is self-contained. All manufacturing, cleaning, pretreatmentand finishing are done at a single facility. The original pretreatment line at the Systems I plant is still used for parts going to the liquid and powder coating lines. Pretreatment is a seven-stage iron-phosphate spray system. The first stage is Bonderite 3212 and cleaner 3140 from Parker Amchem followed by two heated and filtered tap-water rinses. The fourth stage is the same as stage one. Stage one cleans the gross contaminants, while stage four provides more thorough cleaning and iron phosphate deposition. The Bonderite 3212 is a low-temperature iron-phosphate conversioncoating forsteel. It produces a nonmetallic, iron phosphate coating that inhibitscorrosionand increases the adhesion and durability of the paint finishes. Stage five is a heated tap-water rinse. Stage six is 95A Parcolene non-chromesealer. Stage seven is a recirculated RO rinse with a fresh ROcounterflowingrinse for polishing. Parcolene 95A chromium-free post treatmentincreases thecorrosion resistance of the painted metal surface. The pretreated products then travel through a heated dry-off oven andinto thespecially built powder coating room. Steelcase did not add to the originalfacility to house the powder coating system. Instead, it built the roomwithinthe building. The room is maintained at 70 to 74F and 50 pct humidity. The six booths in the powder coating room use one conveyor line. Eachbooth isdedicated to a color. Booths are rolled on and off line as needed. As a boothisrolled on line, the lights above the booth are programmed to turn on. Whenthebooth is rolled off line, the lights go off after 30 seconds. Then the lightsabove the off-line booth go on so that it can be cleaned. Gene Jager, finishing engineer, explained that this helps the companysave money. It may not seem like a big deal, but it is indicative of the company's attention to detail and pursuit of cost-reduction opportunities. A central vacuum system is used to clean the booth components daily.More intensive vacuuming and cleaning are done on each booth weekly. There are two line speeds. Complex parts having Faraday cage areas arerun at 22 fpm; flat panels are run at 25 fpm. A bank of 11 reciprocating guns is positioned on both sides of each booth. One side also has seven stationary guns that are used only to powder coat drawer interiors. Hand guns are used for touchup. Another necessary procedure is the air-drying system for compressed airgoingto the powder system. The air is maintained at 38F pressure dew point or80 psi.To do this, Steelcase uses a refrigerated air-drying system. Backpulsing the filter is done only as needed. When a certain staticpressureis reached, the filters are pulsed. This saves money because compressedair isused only as needed. "Compressed air is expensive to generate," noted Mr.Jager. Powder is fed into the hoppers from 1,200-lb boxes. The oversprayedpowder isreclaimed and blended with virgin powder in a 30 pct reclaim to 70 pctvirginratio. Each booth has two hoppers to accommodate the large number ofapplicators.One sieve is used for each booth to filter the powder. Parts go from the powder coating room to the gas-fired convection ovenswherethey are cured for 20 min at 350F. The biggest reject is light paint. For this, parts are simply run through the powder coating booths a second time. Steelcase has a 98 pct acceptance rate on its parts. "We used to have only a 95 pct acceptance rate until Nordson developed a current limiter for the electrostatic handguns," said Mr. Jager. The current limiter allows users to set the gun current at a level thatwillprovide optimal powder charge and field strength for each application.Currentcontrol ensures that the number of ions generated in the charge zone issufficient to charge the powder effectively, but not high enough to createexcessive free-ion current on the already deposited powder layer. The decision to go to powder coating was environmentally driven, butSteelcasewas not willing to sacrifice quality. Its extensive research paid off. Thepowdercoating system at the System I facility helped Steelcase maintain qualityandimprove the environment.

By Beverly A. Graves Editor Before he retires in 1999, John Maliszewski, CEO of Reliable Plating Works, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, plans to have his plant at zero discharge. He already has one fully automated line at zero discharge and another well on its way. The third line will be completed within two years. Planning for zero discharge began two years ago and included the addition of a nickel-chromium plating line and facility. The addition includes 26,000 sq ft of warehouse, manufacturing and office space built by Briohn Building Corp., a company partially owned by Mr. Maliszewski. The new nickel-chromium line uses a mix of reverse osmosis and ion exchange technology, counterflow rinses and evaporation to achieve zero discharge. Not only did Reliable work on planning the building and plating line, it worked with Atotech USA, Inc., Somerset, New Jersey, to develop a trivalent chromium plating chemistry that would produce a blue-bright finish that rivaled hexavalent chromium. As part of its plan, Reliable plated customers' parts with both trivalent and hexavalent chromium and mixed the finished parts together in the shipments. When Reliable asked its customers to distinguish between hexavalent and trivalent chromium plated parts, they could not tell the difference. After six months, Reliable went to its customers and explained that the trivalent chromium produced the same appearance as the hexavalent without the hazardous wastes associated with hexavalent chromium plating. Reliable wanted to plate all trivalent chromium as part of the zero-discharge plan. Customers in the automotive, appliance, furniture and paper dispenser businesses liked the zero-discharge plan and gave Reliable the "go-ahead" to plate trivalent instead of hexavalent chromium. The return-type, programmed automated-hoist plating line from Jessup Engineering has the capability to run a number of processes. At present it is programmed to run five different cycles. Reliable has the ability to make minor adjustments to the programs. If a new program or troubleshooting is required, the system is hooked up via computer modem to Jessup, who can make changes and help Reliable with any problems 24-hrs a day, seven days a week. "We may not be a big company," stated Jaime Maliszewski, president and son of John, "but many of our customers are. If we are down, our customers are down." Parts begin at the cleaning tanks where they undergo: Before use, city water is cycled through either reverse osmosis or ion exchange. Reliable found that the only way it could achieve zero discharge was to "cleanup" the city water. The process removes lead, copper, magnesium, calcium, sulfur and other contaminants. These contaminants could end up in the final sludge, making it undesirable for reclamation. Or they could interfere with the plating process. Reliable knows that the cleaner the trivalent chromium solution, the better the appearance of the finished parts. This is especially true for trivalent chromium plating. Water from the rinse tank after the electrocleaner is run through a sand filter, carbon filter and ion exchange. Water from the ion exchange column is then pumped back into the final rinse of the cleaning process at 10 gpm. All rinses in the cleaning cycle are counterflowed. When one of the two alternating ion exchange columns is backwashed (every third day), solution flows to a 6,500-gal heated surge tank. It requires approximately 800 gal of water to backwash one ion exchange column. From the surge tank, backwash is then pumped through an evaporator to reduce the volume by 1,805 gpd. Material from the evaporator is pumped into a 6,500 gal by-product tank. When the by-product tank is full, it will be shipped to Inmetco, Ellwood City, Pennsylvania, for reclamation. Mr. Maliszewski estimates that it will take three and a half years before the first shipment is made. Backwash from the sand filter is also pumped into the by-product tank and shipped for reclamation. Oil removal from the cleaning solutions is being examined and if successful will be shipped to Heritage Environmental, Indianapolis, Indiana. Strippers are evaporated into a heavy paste that is sent to Inmetco. Periodically, the filtration systems are blown down. All the Slim Line filters from Anode Products have a built-in adapter, originally designed by Reliable Plating, through which compressed air is fed. This dries the filter contents, which are then bagged and shipped to Inmetco for reclamation. Following cleaning, parts enter one of eight nickel tanks, each containing 10 oz/gal of nickel and running at 50 asf, 145F. DI water is used for makeup and process water on the plating line. There is no running water after the acid dip rinse. There are triple counterflowing rinse tanks with spray rinses following the nickel plating process. The available nickel plating processes include bright nickel at 0.5 mil, satin nickel at 0.5 mil, duplex nickel at 0.5 or 1.2 mil thickness. All of the nickel tanks have Techmatic, Inc. evaporators, which evaporate solution at 40 gph. "We have evaporated nearly 270,000 gal from our nickel tanks in the first three months, and 7,000 gal from our trivalent tanks so far this year," Mr. Maliszewski estimated. All the nickel solutions are run continuously through a carbon filtration system at 5,000 gph. Following nickel plating, parts enter the trivalent chromium tanks. The trivalent chromium contains 2.7 to 3 oz/gal of trivalent chromium and 7.1 oz/gal of boric acid. It is run at 50 asf and 110F. This is followed by a 130F triple counterflowing rinse. The trivalent chromium tank also has an evaporator that evaporates solution at 40 gph. After trivalent chromium plating, welded parts are passivated in a 140F solution containing 0.5 oz/gal hexavalent chromium. That is followed by a 130F triple counterflow rinse. The hexavalent chromium tank has a Cosmos Minerals Corp. purifier on it along with evaporation. The purifier keeps the trivalent chromium out and the chlorides down. Bath concentrations are manually maintained. Temperature is controlled automatically and amp-hr meters are used for brightener control. Hull cell tests are run daily, and once a month Atotech runs tests on the plating solutions. There are no sewers (except sanitary) in the new facility. The cement used in the floor was made from silica, which is ten times finer than regular concrete. With the epoxy coating on it, it is able to withstand 50 pct sulfuric acid for an unlimited time. "The city (Milwaukee) told us that if we get our older lines operating like the newer one, they would no longer have to come into the plant. We would have to supply six months of documentation first," noted Mr. Maliszewski. "My sons are taking over the company, and I won't leave until it is zero discharge. I don't want the liability."

By David Whedon Plant Manager Southern Aluminum Finishing Nashville, Tennessee Give Southern Aluminum Finishing (SAF) a design challenge and its aluminum fabrication and applications experts will provide a solution. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, the company was founded in 1946. Within a few years it expanded into metals distribution. By 1962, plant capacity had grown and Alcoa's Duranodic process was incorporated. A decade later a second anodizing plant came on line in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1977 the Atlanta paint line opened, followed by state-of-the-art two-step anodizing. The 1980s brought about the expansion of SAF's custom aluminum fabrication business, and in 1989 powder coating came on line. Purchasing an old coil line. In August, 1993 the coil anodizing division faced a challenge when it purchased an old coil line from a recently closed coil anodizing facility. Much of the badly neglected equipment needed repair, reconditioning or replacement. Problems that prevented the line from operating were addressed first. Reconditioning the line. Reconditioning began with repairing leaks in processing tanks that had developed after years of galvanic corrosion. Both the pre-seal and hot-seal tanks required complete relining with fabricated stainless sheet. Problems with the boiler and related systems were tackled next. The boiler was in miserable shape and the second pass tubes required replacing. Massive scale deposits had accumulated during years of operation without chemical treatments. Workers removed the scale and set up a chemical treatment system. A state-of-the-art Honeywell controller replaced the obsolete vacuum tube boiler controls. Many steam coils were also replaced, and steam traps and vacuum breakers added. The design of the steam ventilation system was inadequate for solution heating. It was modified in order to reach the temperatures necessary to achieve seals needed to pass the Acid Dissolution Test (ADT). There were no temperature control systems on any of the individual process tanks; consequently, controllers were added to each tank. Two of 28 anodizing power-supply modules were completely missing. Faulty transformers plagued three of the remaining 26 units. The result was a reduction in the original design capacity of 17.8 pct. All five modules were replaced. In addition, all the remaining 23 modules were completely reconditioned. The power-supply control package required factory repair. All bussing connections were remade and new cable connections installed. Even the cathodes required repositioning for even distribution of the anodic coating over both sides of the sheet. The refrigeration system also required attention. Workers replaced two of four system compressors immediately. The condenser operated temporarily until its replacement arrived. Refrigeration controls were also replaced. Violations by the previous owner had forced the local regulatory agency to plug the discharge line in the wastewater system. SAF designed and installed a PLC-controlled wastewater treatment system before the first test coil was pulled through the line to ensure compliance with all federal, state and local environmental regulations. In early 1994, many engineering projects were scheduled around production. Some of the more prominent projects included roller leveling and alignment, frictionless anodizing roller rotation, improved color uniformity and water conservation. SAF personnel quickly learned the importance of precision balancing, leveling and roller alignment. During the first alignment project, entire tanks were moved as much as three inches. One end of a set of pinch rollers was raised more than two inches. Machinists performed the roller balancing. SAF personnel, however, performed all leveling and alignment activities. Leveling equipment progressed from a carpenter's level to precision machinist level, while alignment techniques progressed from using strings to lasers. Through SAF-developed techniques, the entire line can be aligned and leveled to plus or minus 0.001 inch within one eight-hr shift. One particularly difficult roller problem involved the Teflon bushings used as anodizing roller bearings. Not only did they require frequent replacement, resulting in downtime, but even new bushings were not sufficiently friction free to allow foil range gages to turn the rollers. Complete redesign was required. Adding dyeing. When SAF entered the dye market, new problems arose. Coating uniformity on both the sheet's top and bottom became critical. In addition, uniform dye distribution was necessary. SAF engineered the necessary modifications and began producing consistent color both across and on both sides of the sheet. Using a HunterLab spectrocolorimeter allows SAF to maintain color throughout production runs with variation that is undetectable by the human eye. Water conservation is also a priority. With the addition of numerous recycling streams, water use dropped 83 pct for some materials processed. As SAF's success with water conservation increased, concentrations of metals in the wastewater also increased. To ensure compliance, separate batch systems for separation and removal of nickel and copper were installed. During the first year of operation, the company did not aggressively seek sales. This allowed time for SAF to complete major engineering projects. As projects concluded, sales activity increased. During the second year increasing the capabilities of the line was a priority. If the line was to produce a high-performance, highly aesthetic, quality product, much work was still required. Although SAF employed four degreed engineers and two degreed chemists with anodizing experience, many obstacles they confronted were unknowns due to the differences in batch and coil anodizing. Troubleshooting was often difficult. With these obstacles removed, SAF's capabilities increased and quality coil anodizing projects were sought aggressively, including large and small jobs. Capabilities One-side or two-side option. Immediately upon entering the coil anodizing market, SAF discovered the necessity of offering customers the option of having either one or both sides of the coil anodized. Although many customers require anodizing on both sides, it is not necessary in many applications. Tight color tolerances maintained. SAF uses a spectrocolorimeter to ensure each customer's color specifications match consistently. In the past, anodizing relied on operator subjectivity using high- and low-range samples. Sometimes light booths were added to help. Color matching was more of an art than a science. The spectrocolorimeter makes color matching a science. Eight stock colors. SAF stores eight stock colors on site, including red, yellow, teal, green, brown, black, purple and lavender. On-site color matching. For customers requesting a custom color, SAF has a dye lab on site. The customer supplies a sample and tells the chemist the application. A match is recommended using an appropriate dye. Light-fast dyes are recommended if the product will be used outdoors. Seal to specification. Many customers require a seal that passes the ADT seal quality test (ASTM B680-80), including many automotive and architectural applications. The line produces coating thicknesses ranging up to 0.425 mil for both clear and dyed coatings. For coating thicknesses greater than 0.425 mil, the dye tank provides additional seal time but eliminates the dye step, limiting the product to clear coatings. Many interior applications do not require a passing ADT. In this case, SAF offers a seal that simply passes a dye stain test (ASTM B136-69), and is less expensive. PVC application. To protect the anodized finish during handling, PVC application is available as the anodized coil is recoiled. Slitting. On-site slitting is available to tolerances of plus or minus 0.005 inch. With the addition of an edge guide, the company now offers "zero edge trim" slitting capability. Someone once said, "Be thankful for problems. If they were less difficult, someone with less ability might have your job." Loosely translated, if it was easy, everyone would be doing it. These were some of the difficulties SAF faced during its renovation of an old coil anodizing line. The result is a one-stop shopping. When combining all the coil anodizing and slitting capabilities in Nashville, with the cut-to-length, fabricating, painting and batch anodizing capabilities of the Atlanta and Charlotte facilities, SAF offers one-stop shopping for aluminum coil processing.

This article covers nickel-iron and nickel-cobalt applications... By S. Alec Watson Nickel Development Institute Toronto, Ontario Canada Nickel alloys electroplated for engineering applications include nickel-iron, nickel-cobalt, nickel-manganese and zinc- nickel. Iron is an inexpensive metal and solutions for plating nickel-iron alloys were developed mainly to reduce costs. However, they were also developed for special magnetic purposes. Cobalt and manganese are used to increase the hardness and strength of nickel plating. Additionally, nickel-manganese alloys have improved resistance to sulfur embrittlement when heated. Coatings of nickel-tungsten show high resistance to corrosion, but they are believed not to be true alloys and have not been used in practice. Nickel-Iron Bright nickel-iron plating was strongly promoted as a substitute for bright nickel plating from 1970 to the early 1980s, when the relative price of nickel was high. Advantages. The main advantage is the cost savings, because up to 35 pct of the nickel is replaced with iron. An additional advantage is that iron entering the plating solution through chemical dissolution of steel substrates, which is highly detrimental in straight nickel plating solutions, is readily dissolved and subsequently plated out. This feature is particularly relevant during plating onto tubular steel parts. Ductility is usually higher for the alloy coatings than for bright nickel, which may be advantageous if the plated parts are subject to deformation. Disadvantages. The organic addition agents are more expensive than those for bright nickel, negating the savings on metal. The addition agent system is also more complex, so electrolyte control is more difficult. At equal thickness, nickel-iron plating is less resistant to corrosion than nickel. The higher the iron content, the lower its corrosion resistance. Process Description. Preferred solutions for plating bright nickel-iron are slightly more dilute than nickel plating solutions in order to obtain a high iron alloy without using a high iron concentration in the solution. A typical solution is given in Table I. Addition agents include stabilizers for the ferrous iron, organic brighteners, leveling agents and wetting agents. Total iron includes ferrous and ferric ions. It is important to control the ratio, keeping ferric ions below 20 pct. Solution temperature is typically 130 to 140F. The pH must be kept at 2.8 to 3.6. It is better to use air agitation, since higher plating rates can be achieved than with cathode rod movement. A higher iron content can be altered by increasing or reducing the rate of air bubbling. Properties of the deposit that are of interest include ductility, hardness, internal stress and magnetics. Ductility depends on iron content, brightener concentration, solution temperature and pH. Deposit hardness varies with iron content. When iron content increases from zero to about 10 pct, microhardness rises from 490 to 560 HK1. It falls to about 510 HK with 49 pct iron for coatings plated at standard conditions of 40 amps/sq ft, 140F and pH 3.5, with air agitation. Changes in solution pH and brightener concentration also influence deposit hardness, enabling values exceeding 700 HV2 to be achieved. Internal stress is tensile, in contrast to that of most bright nickel deposits. It is influenced by iron content and more sharply by solution pH. Increasing iron content raises stress from 13,500 to 22,400 psi. Increasing pH from 2.8 to 4.5 raises stress from 2,500 to 33,600 psi. Magnetic properties of nickel-iron are not important in the application of bright decorative coatings. However, similar alloys are deposited for magnetic applications from solutions not containing brighteners. The alloys with 18 to 25 pct iron are soft magnetic materials with low coercive force, low remanence and high maximum permeability. They can be used as coatings or as electroformed parts. Nickel-Cobalt Some of the earliest solutions for bright-nickel plating contained cobalt, formate and formaldehyde. With the development of modern bright-nickel solutions based on organic addition agents only, the cobalt-containing solutions have fallen into disuse. Today, the cobalt additions are used when necessary to increase the hardness and strength of nickel plating, especially in electroforming applications. Advantages. Compared with nickel itself, nickel-cobalt alloys are harder and stronger. In contrast to nickel hardened with conventional organic addition agents such as naphthalene 1-3-6 trisulfonic acid, nickel-cobalt alloys can be heated to high temperatures without embrittlement by sulfur. Disadvantages. The need to maintain the cobalt ion level introduces an additional maintenance requirement. Also, internal stress is moved in the tensile direction, and there is a practical limit to the level of cobalt that can be used. Hence, the maximum hardness of about 400 HV is less than the 600 HV that can be attained using conventional organic additives. Process Description. Most of the data about nickel-cobalt plating were determined using a 600 g/liter nickel sulfamate solution. The initial charge of cobalt is added to the base solution as cobalt sulfamate. Replenishment during operation is usually made by metered additions of cobalt sulfamate. It can be achieved, however, by dividing the anodic current between a nickel anode and a cobalt anode, so that the percentage of total current passing to the cobalt is the same as the percentage of cobalt required in the alloy deposited at the cathode. Good control of cobalt content is necessary. Processing variables and properties of the alloy plated from a 600 g/liter nickel sulfamate solution. With solution composition and pH standardized, the cobalt content and alloy properties depend on solution temperature and current density. The properties are modified by subsequent heat treatment and simultaneous use of sulfur-free organic addition agents. Alloy hardness. The relationship between cobalt content and deposit hardness is shown in Figure 1. The brown curve shows microhardness versus cobalt content in the deposits formed at 50 amps/sq ft. The green curve shows microhardness versus cobalt content in the solution. A peak hardness of about 520 HV is attained with six g/liter cobalt in the solution. This provides an alloy containing about 34 pct cobalt. At peak hardness, internal tensile stress is too high for electroforming applications, although the alloy can be used as a coating on a solid substrate. For electroforming purposes, the limit of tolerable deposit stress is reached with alloys containing about 15 pct cobalt that have hardnesses around 350 to 400 HV. Alloy hardness depends on both the cobalt content of the solution and the deposition current density. Figure 2 shows hardness plotted against current density for different concentrations of cobalt in a solution operated at 140F, pH 4. Deposit stress also depends on current density. Moving left to right along any of the curves, deposit stress changes from compressive through zero to tensile. The superimposed thin black line is a zero-stress contour linking the combination of cobalt ion concentration and current density for zero-stress alloys. The corresponding value of deposit hardness can be read from the graph for each combination. The overall relationship is that the higher the cobalt ion concentration, the lower the current density that can be used for zero-stress alloys, but the higher the alloy's hardness. Effect of Heating. Heating at temperatures to 570F has little effect on the mechanical properties of the alloys. At higher temperatures deposit hardness falls, but nickel-cobalt alloys still retain greater hardness than that of nickel deposits similarly heat treated. Tensile strength, 150,000 psi for a 15 pct cobalt alloy and 108,000 psi for a 10 pct cobalt alloy, falls progressively as heat treatment temperature is increased above 570F. Deposit ductility increases on heating above 570F, from five pct elongation as-deposited to about 40 pct after heating at 1100F for both 10 and 15 pct cobalt alloys. Properties of alloys from other nickel solutions. The preceding data apply to alloys from a 600 g/liter nickel-sulfamate solution. A nickel-cobalt alloy deposited from a 450 g/liter solution without chloride or organic additions, operated at 126F, pH 4 and cathodic current density 23 amps/sq ft has a hardness of 350 to 400 HV, ductility less than five pct and internal tensile stress of 7,000 to 9,000 psi. Measurements of the effects of heat treatment at 400F on alloys containing 53 to 55 pct cobalt indicated a small increase in yield strength. Heat treatment at 500F or more reduces yield strength, as with alloys from the 600 g/liter nickel sulfamate solution. Prior heat treatment of the 53 to 55 pct cobalt alloys at 500F, 700F or 800F improves mechanical properties. Thus pretreatment for four hours at 800F, increases yield strength and elongation. Alloys deposited from a sulfosalicylate-based solution exhibit at maximum hardness value above 700 HV. Nickel-Chromium Nickel alloys with 22 pct chromium can be prepared by co-depositing chromium carbide particles with nickel and heat treating for 24 hours at 1800F in hydrogen. Alloy hardness after heat treatment is 223 HV, compared with 55 HV for similarly treated plain nickel. Alloys containing 19 pct cobalt or 20 pct iron in addition to chromium are produced by co-depositing chromium carbide from a nickel-cobalt or nickel-iron based solution and heat treating. Heat treatment in hydrogen gives almost complete decarburization with the nickel-cobalt-chromium alloys. Hardness after heat treatment is 215 HV. Approximately 0.8 pct carbon remains in the nickel-iron-chromium alloy, which may account for its higher hardness of 332 HV. For practical purposes, the environmental, health and safety considerations for these nickel-based alloys and their production are the same as those for nickel and nickel plating.

By Beverly A. Graves Editor It is only natural that a clean and environmentally friendly technology such as Low Temperature Arc Vapor Deposition (LTAVD) was developed in Boulder, Colorado. Here many people ride bicycles to work and school. A clear running creek winds through the town, and the Rocky Mountains provide a perfect backdrop for this growing city. In 1981, Vapor Technologies of Boulder, a division of Masco Corp., developed LTAVD along with other thin film coating techniques. The present company was incorporated in 1988, and the first major commercialization of the processes and equipment started in 1989. Since that time, Vapor Technologies has continued to thrive and grow. The LTAVD process is the technical centerpiece of its business. The process deposits a variety of functional and decorative metallic coatings on virtually any substrate from metals to plastic. It is used for automotive decorative styling and functional components, medical devices and instruments, EMI/RFI/ESD shielding on plastic electronic housings, functional coatings for aerospace applications and decorative coatings on household hardware, jewelry and plastics. Obviously, the parts can vary widely in shape, size and configuration. LTAVD is a physical vapor deposition process that employs a high-current, low-voltage electric arc to evaporate essentially any electrically conductive material. The material to be deposited is fashioned as a cylindrical source on which the electric arc is ignited. The deposition process is operated in a highly controlled vacuum to deposit adherent, dense, thin-film coatings. LTAVD has a number of advantages over other physical vapor deposition techniques, as well as benefits not found in chemical vapor deposition. LTAVD coatings are highly adherent as well as wear and corrosion resistant. Also, LTAVD can coat at room temperature or higher and does not add significant thermal energy (heat) to the substrate. Heat can be detrimental to parts, causing loss of temper, deformation or a change in crystal structure. The process is highly productive; deposition occurs over a 360 degree field rather than a 180 degree field. Thus, parts being coated are always in the coating plasma, a significant advantage for film quality and deposition rate. Electrodes can be configured in any shape necessary to "fit" the parts being coated. When a planetary fixture is not feasible, the electrode can be configured to coat the substrate without moving the substrate, such as a pipe coated on the inside and outside with a single electrode. However, both the substrate and electrode can be moved if necessary. Electrodes can be made from solid sintered, cold-pressed powder ingot of any metal, alloy or carbon class materials. Because there is little waste heat and low thermal radiation, the process has the ability to deposit materials with high melting points onto substrates with low melting points. So, high-melting-point metals like tungsten (3410C) can be applied to plastic films without using a heat sink and without damaging the substrate. The energies of the metallic ions ejected from the electrode are high (60 to 100 electron-volts/ion). The ionization percentage is excellent, greater than 90 pct, which allows for good mechanical adhesion even if the substrate temperature is ambient. When substrates are heated, there is good mechanical adhesion, depending on the substrate. Elevated temperatures do not interfere with the process, so the temperature of the substrate is totally controllable. Because the arc travels on the electrode surface, its speed is controllable. The area to be coated can be fine tuned from a narrow area to a full 360 degrees of coverage. Coating uniformity is provided by the uniformity of the arc's traverse across the surface of the electrode, with a spent electrode appearing as if it has been uniformly eroded or milled. Coating rates and uniformity are excellent. Deposition rates are rapid. Film thickness varies from 300 angstroms to a few mils, depending on what is specified. Deposition rates are inversely proportional to distance. With high melting point, high-density metals and ceramics, deposition rates are lower. The erosion rate for nickel is more than one gram per min per electrode. A typical uniformity specification is plus or minus five pct for thin-film processes. Large areas or volumes can be coated uniformly because of the high rate of deposition, capacity for large target sizes and the large vacuum chamber. Alloy Coatings. Dissimilar materials can be alloyed using LTAVD. Materials not commercially available can be deposited using the process. This requires synthesis of a target, then deposition using LTAVD. This is useful for compounds such as titanium/aluminum and others that have different melting and evaporation points. The purity of the deposited materials is the same as the starting materials. Alloys preserve their composition through the coating process. Ceramic materials can be synthesized by evaporating a metal or alloy in the presence of a low-pressure reactive gas, resulting in materials such as titanium carbonitride (TiCN) and titanium oxide. Pure carbon can also be evaporated. Environmental Issues. The LTAVD process is safe for the environment and workers. No hazardous or toxic materials are produced. The process produces no VOCs. The only effluent generated is vaporized oil from the vacuum pumps; however most of this is captured in a cold trap that condenses the effluent and causes the oil to separate out. Vapor Technologies has 14 batch coating service chambers at its facility. At the time of this writing, Vapor Technologies had four units under fabrication for proprietary customers. LTAVD systems typically accommodate one target to produce three to four coatings. The new VT3500 can accommodate more than one target. This means users do not have to dedicate a system to one target material. The targets (material sources) can be interchanged quickly and easily. Vapor Tech performs contract coating, custom equipment design and fabrication as well as contract research and development. The company will help users develop the precise process to fit their needs, giving full consideration to the functional and decorative requirements of each application. Vapor Technologies' quality initiative is to be ISO 9000 certified within the next 12 to 13 months. The well-equipped materials laboratory includes a scanning electron microscope with elemental analysis, x-ray diffractometer, spectroradio-meter to measure transmittance and reflectivity, atomic absorption spectroscope and equipment for measuring the density, surface profile and microhardness, stress, sheet and point conductivity and coating adhesion, among other capabilities. Applications. Plastic aerodynamic forms have been metallized. Plastic automobile grilles, bumpers, buttons, knobs and handles have been coated with scratch-resistant, reflective materials such as gold, chromium, brass, copper, titanium. The coatings give plastic the cosmetic metal appearance consumers prefer as well as providing for weight and cost reductions. A wide array of highly reflective coatings can be deposited on the plastics used in headlamp housings. Single layer reflective coatings are corrosion and scratch resistance. Highly reflective coatings with smooth basecoats and protective topcoats can also be produced. LTAVD has also been used to coat substrates that cannot be heated more than a few hundred degrees, such as epoxy metal composites, and substrates with complex surface geometries. The coatings include a variety of metals and reacted metal nitrides, carbides and oxides. These coatings solve problems caused by corrosive and oxidative hot gases, acids, caustics, organics and molten materials. Areas of ongoing research at Vapor Technologies include diamond coatings using a patented process called Compact Linear Filtered Arc and overall improvement of LTAVD coatings. Vapor Technologies' customers prefer to keep their names confidential for competitive reasons, albeit, applications of LTAVD are abundant throughout the door lock, plumbing and window hardware industries. Coatings are applied to locksets using LTAVD. The finish provides not only the specularity and cosmetic appeal the company is looking for, but the corrosion resistance its customers demand. Coated locksets have been salt spray tested for more than 1,200 hrs, without any sign of discoloration. The BHMA standard is 96 hrs. The locksets also withstood UV and scratch tests with "equal vigor." This has allowed the lock company to provide a lifetime anti-tarnis warranty on its locksets' finish in addition to its standard mechanical components. LTAVD is used to apply a brass color coating over brass faucets and other plumbing accessories. Plumbing hardware coatings must withstand more than 90 cleaning products from store-bought brands to specially made custom-cleaning solutions. The faucets are scratch resistant. The finish has allowed the customers to provide a lifetime warranty against corrosion, pitting and discoloration. Vapor Technologies' coating applications are as diverse as the imaginations of its customers. With coatings as thin as one-thousandth the thickness of a human hair, the properties and performance of a substrate may be entirely changed. The coating processes can alleviate material limitations as the critical path in product improvement and development.

Advanced Quick Circuits (AQC), a division of Rossi Electronics, Inc., Melbourne, Florida, blends production and design experience for producing high-quality, high-density printed circuit boards with quick customer response. Vital to its board-manufacturing capability are on-line inspection systems with added backup for quick response. According to AQC, its primary market niche is in the advanced engineering arena where response time, high technology and customer service are the driving forces. In its 100,000-sq-ft manufacturing plant, high-density PCBs are made for manufacturers in the telecommunications, computer peripheral and military electronics industries. AQC has also provided PCBs for the Hellfire, Titan and F-16 military programs. AQC originated as Advanced Board Circuitries in 1974. In 1983, an investment group, which included Charles Rossi, Jr., purchased Advanced Board Circuitries from Storage Technologies. In 1989, Advanced Board Circuitries and Quick Circuits, Inc., merged to become AQC. Quick Circuits was started in 1980 by Charles Rossi, Jr. to serve the small-quantity, quick-turn-around PCB market. Some of AQC's capabilities include Hi-Rel boards that are manufactured to such specifications as UL-94V-O, MIL-P-5510 Types 1,2 and 3, Bellcore, MIL-Std 2000 and MIL-I-45208. Its technological expertise includes the manufacture of multi-layer boards up to 24 layers. Materials used to make the boards include: FR-4, FR-5, BT, cyanate ester, polyimide and Kevlar. Boards are run through a series of tests, including net list download, fine-pitch surface mount, clamshell and high voltage. "All products, both military and commercial, are measured during in-process inspections," explained Judy Gehman, quality analyst. Critical functions must be controlled. Internal copper weight is critical for current-carrying capacity and heat dissipation. Customer specification requirements range from 50 to 300 microinches; a one mil minimum of copper is required in plated-through holes to ensure proper contact of interconnections and for mechanical strength and stability of the hole. Tin-lead plating provides protection for the base metal and a solderable surface for subsequent processing. Requirements are typically 300 microinches minimum prior to fusing. The composition of tin-lead (63 pct tin and 37 pct lead) ensures that the plating deposit can be fused at the minimum possible temperature to avoid delamination of the circuit boards. AQC uses its high-tech coating thickness measuring systems for in-process inspection directly at the plating lines. The systems have helped the Quality Control Department assure proper copper weight prior to lamination. Copper and tin-lead thicknesses are measured prior to etch, to identify improper process variations that can lead to rejects. Gold-nickel and electroless nickel thicknesses are also measured. The company uses two bench-type MRX thickness measuring systems from CMI International, Elk Grove Village, Illinois. They operate on the microresistance and eddy-current principles. One MRX system is located at the Automated Optical Inspection area to ensure copper weight of inner PCB layers prior to lamination. Another MRX system is located at Plate Audit to ensure proper copper thickness of plated through holes prior to etch. A single-screen XRX x-ray fluorescence coating thickness measuring system is also located at Plate Audit to ensure tin-lead and alloy thickness prior to etch and to verify the thickness of gold-nickel and electroless nickel plate. The printer-equipped thickness measuring systems take measurements from a sample of each board lot. The statistical data are printed and shipped along with the lot to Quality Control. Random lots are selected and thickness averages are plotted daily on X-bar and R charts as part of the process control for each plating tank. Incorrect internal copper weight results in lost materials, inspection time, processing and press time, and, more importantly, jeopardized delivery time. "If copper and tin-lead thickness are incorrect after etch, you can estimate that these costs or losses are at least five times greater," Ms. Gehman estimated. "The savings are a combination of reduced man-hours, less scrap, reduced material costs, plus savings in process time and destructive testing. Back-up equipment is used for handling production increases. AQC strives for zero downtime and consistent on-time deliveries. "All of our back-up equipment is also maintained with current calibration certification and is ready to go on-line anytime, day or night," said Ms. Gehman. The XRX single-screen system measures the thickness of virtually any coating on any base, including multilayers. The system's slotted chamber easily measures large printed circuit boards up to 25 by 36 inches, as well as small electronic parts. The XRX also provides AQC with "Point and Shoot" automatic table positioning technology. The correct plating thickness is crucial to the manufacturing of quality printed circuit boards. Testing the thickness while the products are on line allows for fast turnaround, allowing Advanced Quick Circuits to live up to its name.

Products Finishing Staff Michigan Seat Company, Jackson, Michigan, is a leading manufacturer of lawn and garden tractor seats. There were times when its paint line's reject rate reached more than 15 pct. An investigation revealed that the source of the problem was the compressed air it used in the paint booths. As parts exited the 62-ft-long, three-stage washer, painters used the compressed air guns to remove excess liquid from the parts. However, painters were unable to completely blow-off cleaner/phosphate solution from the steel seats because of clogged nozzles. There was also concern about oil and other contaminants that could get into the compressed air system. The conveyor runs at 16.5 fpm. Also, it was costly to produce the compressed air. Maintenance Supervisor Bill Petrie stated, "Compressed air may be the most expensive product a plant produces using electricity." To Mr. Petrie, the compressed air for blow-off was "one huge air leak." Larry Douglas, Michigan Seat's paint line supervisor, had another problem to solve as well. There was not enough floor space to establish a normal drying line. Mr. Douglas had to find a blow-off method that could be installed in a minimum amount of space. He also needed to find a system that could be easily and quickly adjusted to handle a variety of seat configurations, since the company produces 19 styles. (Simply listing the bolt-hole configurations requires 25 computer pages.) Also, Mr. Douglas needed to find a solution quickly. With 10,000 plus parts moving through the two robotic paint booths each day, the 15 pct reject rate was unacceptable. Mr. Douglas decided to install a 30-hp air knife system. Two separate banks of flexible coupled air knife nozzles handle the work. One bank is stationed at a 90-deg turn in the line where the seats leave the washer and move toward the infrared heaters. This first bank eliminates large pools of liquid. Another bank of air knives immediately follows the 12-ft-long bank of infrared heaters. This rids the parts of any remaining traces of liquid before they enter the robotic paint booth. Michigan Seat Company installed the air knife system using PVC pipe to feed the two banks of knives. Twin rows of 12 nozzles flank the seats as they move along the conveyor lines. Depending on which seat configurations are produced, different nozzles are used. The direction of the nozzles also depends on the seats going through the line. The nozzles have articulated connectors, allowing employees to easily redirect blow-off air to handle whatever seat type is running. The blow-off system was made by Invincible AirKnife Systems, Baltic Ohio. The company has cut its reject rate to below 0.005 pct. It has also eliminated compressed air and lowered labor costs. Maintenance is minimal. Filters are replaced monthly in about five min. Bob Nelson, Michigan Seat's plant engineer, points out that when he installs the plant's new powder coating line and seven-stage stainless steel washer, he will move the air knife operation to serve on the new line.

It chose to install a new powder coating system . . . Leggett and Platt, Inc. is a leading supplier of specialty components for the furniture and bedding industries. In addition, it manufactures finished products, including sleep-related, private-label furniture and a variety of non-furnishing items. By combining strategic acquisitions, product innovation and strict controls over manufacturing costs, the company has achieved record sales for the past three years. The company operates more than 150 manufacturing facilities. The Masterack Division operates four of those, the largest in Atlanta, Georgia. Thoroughly modern in its thinking and its application of technology and production controls, Masterack is also distinctive in other ways. Most notably, it places extraordinary value on the skills and experience of its 360-member work force. Numerous workers boast 40 years or more experience with the company. The most experienced company employee, Thomas "Mr. June" Garbutt, will commemorate 63 years of continuous service this year. Masterack's philosophy of prioritizing its people and their contributions to the company's success influences every corporate decision. It was a major factor in the firm's decision on how to respond to new environmental requirements. For approximately 30 years, the company finished its ferrous metal products using a conventional liquid spray system. Tightening restrictions on VOC emissions made change inevitable. The options Leggett and Platt considered included outsourcing some or all of the finishing, reducing production, relocating part or all of the division to a site outside the city or re-engineering the production line and installing a powder finishing system. Also affecting the decision was the plant itself. The company had outgrown the facility and extensive remodeling or expansion would be required in the near future. Of the four alternatives, the company only seriously investigated relocation or a new powder line. "The zero-VOC advantage of going to powder was significant," said Bob Stilz, senior manufacturing engineer. "But the decision to change to powder was made in large part because we wanted to maintain our work force. We recognized that many of our workers would be unable to move with the company." The company defines itself as a job shop. Therefore it needed a flexible coating line, since its products were likely to diversify even more over time. A team was assembled that included representatives from the company's chemical vendor (Coral Chemical), paint supplier (Crow Industrial Coatings), application equipment manufacturer (Nordson Corp.), and four members of Masterack's production management, lead by Bob Stilz. For Mr. Stilz, particularly, the stakes were high. In his nine years with the company, his experience with finishing had included electrostatic wet spray and electrocoating, but not powder coating. "This would also be my first ground-zero pro-ject," he added. For the total program (building and powder line), the budget was six million dollars, and the corporate standard on payback was two years. The team began by simply asking many questions. "We asked the chemical people for their best thinking on a spray cleaning system, based on a given time and temperature. We asked the powder application experts to write a specification based on a maximum silhouette of three-by-five-by-10 ft. We asked everyone for recommendations on a system vendor who understood what we needed now and for the future," stated Mr. Stilz. A comprehensive bid package was supplied to five leading vendors. The system consists of nine modules: five-stage washer, dry-off oven, powder booth, environmental room, transit tunnel, bake oven, monorail conveyor, cooling tunnel and rack burn-off oven. The system was limited to a maximum 1,500 linear ft, with a cycle time of one-hour forty-five min or less. Parts had to be cured enough to allow in-line packaging immediately upon exiting the tunnel. In early 1993, following two years of discussion, a turnkey system contract was awarded to George Koch Sons, Evansville, Indiana. Notably, it was Koch equipment that was being replaced after 30 years of continuous use. "A schedule was established," said Mr. Stilz. "It promised 100 pct conversion from wet paint to powder and production in 12 months from the date of our order. In the system, parts are hung manually then spray washed in an alkaline cleaning solution. The five-stage washer features counterflow rinsing and the dwell areas to reduce overflow and contamination as well as minimize wastewater generation. A special nozzle configuration and specific nozzle pressure further optimize rinse efficiencies. Oil separation extends the service life of the cleaner. Parts receive a 90-sec conversion coating of iron phosphate following cleaning. Zinc phosphate, the original choice, would have complicated wastewater management since the company already discharged small quantities of zinc due to its use of Zincrometal and processing of several zinc-plated components. A carefully engineered iron phosphate system provided the metal stabilization required, without the hazardous discharge. Phosphating is followed by a 30 sec ambient rinse and 30 sec non-chrome sealer. Parts are dried for 10 min in a high-velocity oven at 250F. In the two Nordson booths, which operate alternately, a hybrid polyester/epoxy is applied. In applications that demand high exterior durability 100 pct polyester powder is applied. Seven applications modules are used to apply 20 colors. All but one of the modules, the one used for small quantities, is set up for powder reclaim. "For one thing," he explained, "powder does help sell products. One mil was always the goal, but it was hard to achieve with wet spray. We consistently get one mil with powder." The powder bake oven is a convection type. A 20-min cycle at 400 to 450F achieves a metal temperature of 375F, the optimum temperature for even curing. The system is set up to run at 14 fpm but has the capacity to run at seven to 21 fpm. The monorail conveyor, supplied by Greenline Corporation, is an open I-beam that accommodates 100 lbs per trolley. "The system," said Mr. Stilz, "is engineered to move a lot of weight with high reliability over a long time." Following the successful startup of the powder line, Leggett and Platt purchased a wastewater treatment system. The system accommodates every wastewater source and is capable of batch or continuous operation. The system also has a footprint of less than 1,000 sq ft. The wastewater system has eleven modules. Transfer pumps are networked to a level-control system that senses the presence of liquid and delivers material to a 9,000-gal holding tank. Concentrates are bled into the system and rinse waters are transferred to a two-stage neutralization system. Neutralized wastewaters are overflowed to a flocculator where a polyelectrolyte is added to separate the solids/metals from the water. Liquids then overflow to a clarifier where solids settle out and clean water overflows to a final monitoring tank prior to discharge. Sludge is periodically pumped through a filter press where a 30 to 35 pct solids cake is removed for landfill. Chemical addition is automated. A sonic flow device engenders no contact with the liquid, thus maximizing both accuracy and service life. A simplified graphic display provides operating personnel with a clear and complete snapshot of system performance in real time. Flow and final pH records are generated automatically. "This plant was the company's first opportunity to install state-of-the-art, zero-VOC finishing and fully automated wastewater management," said Mr. Stilz. "We can only say that its success has been - in our view, and in the view of our customers - total. The company has been pleased with the environmental benefits of its system also. The Division was recognized for its "commitment to product and environmental quality" in an article From the Source, a quarterly publication of the Georgia EPA Pollution Prevention Assistance Division. In addition to recognizing Masterack's accomplishment of going from over 100 tons of VOCs per year to zero emissions, the article specifically praised "the achievement of a safer working environment, reduced paperwork and reporting, and its commitment to long-time employees."

Diamond Chrome Plating, Inc. in Howell, Michigan, does not use automated plating lines. The sizes and intricate shapes of the parts plated call for special handling, processing and inspection. More than half of the work done is aerospace related, including aircraft landing gear components, hydraulic servo components, engine management parts, actuators, pins and frame parts. The other half is divided among commercial hydraulics, piston rods, cylinders, artillery, crankshaft bearings, dies and molds. According to Jack Beatty, general manager, the work done at Diamond Chrome Plating is labor intensive. Usually, selective plating is done on low-volume parts. All plating is manual, using no barrels. The company will not automate because parts require precision processing. Many of the parts have three different coatings on different areas, and some require as many as 30 separate plating operations. Diamond Chrome Plating maintains more than 20 hard chromium plating tanks capable of handling parts in excess of 30 ft and depths to 10 ft. An array of rectifiers, some capable of delivering more than 10,000 amps, are available for larger parts. Items weighing up to four tons can be processed. Diamond Chrome is one of the two test sites in Michigan involved in a U.S. EPA Common Sense Initiative program run through the Industrial Technology Institute in Ann Arbor. The program is evaluating methods that existing platers can use to meet the new MACT standards without completely replacing ventilation systems. It appears that Diamond Chrome can meet the new standards by using fume suppressants in conjunction with its existing equipment and some work practice modifications. Work is continuing. The plating company is proficient in three general processes: hard chrome, electroless nickel and vacuum cadmium. It generally plates electroless nickel on parts less than three feet long or one and a half feet in diameter. The vacuum cadmium plating chamber handles pieces to approximately five ft long and two ft wide. Limits vary with part geometry. Vacuum cadmium is an engineering coating applied at thicknesses similar to electroplated cadmium (0.0002 to 0.0005 inch nominal). It is done in a vacuum chamber similar to those in traditional vacuum plating. Diamond Chrome also does low embrittlement electrolytic cadmium plating: LHE-cadmium and cadmium-titanium. Other plating capabilities include precision dense chromium, sulfamate nickel and zinc nickel. Abrasive and glass bead blasting, polishing, welding, baking, passivating, cleaning and degreasing as required to prepare parts for plating are some of the company's support operations. "There are two types of plating performed: precision plating to size for immediate use, and overplating (heavy plating) to be ground to finish. In both cases, it is necessary to know the plating thickness. Precision plated parts must meet tolerances called out by the customer. Overplated parts must have sufficient chromium to clean-up in grinding without causing lost grinding time due to excessive plating build-up," said Mr. Beatty. Hand-held CGX coating thickness measurement gages solved the company's problem. Eleven gages are assigned to working leaders in the chromium and cadmium plating departments, as well as the Final Inspection department. Gages also have right angle probes for measuring in holes. This has saved labor costs, since poor quality products are not shipped to customers who end up returning them for rework. Diamond Chrome Plating started operation in January 1954 in a small 7,500-sq-ft building in the center of Howell, Michigan, east of Lansing and west of Detroit. The company started with three employees, one plating tank and a station wagon. Five expansions over the years have resulted in its present 35,000-sq-ft operation that fills a city block and houses offices, laboratory, tool room, storage and processing areas. Approximately 80 employees staff a 24-hr a day operation. Its trucks provide pickup and delivery along the I-94 expressway corridor. The company's plating processes are approved by most aircraft manufacturers. Many of the company's customers supply components to Allied Signal, Boeing, General Dynamics, General Electric, BF Goodrich Landing Gear Division, Hamilton Standard, Menasco, McDonnell Douglas, Messier-Dowty, Pratt and Whitney, and Sikorsky. With end users like these, precision plating is paramount.

By Beverly A. Graves Editor When Eliphalet Remington built his first rifle in 1816, James and Dolley Madison occupied the White House, Indiana became the nineteenth state and the Second Bank of America was established. Little did Mr. Remington know that he was starting what was to become one of the largest firearms companies in the world. The history of the Remington Arms Co. tells the history of the country. One example is General George Armstrong Custer's letter to the company. After an expedition to the Yellowstone area he wrote praising the accuracy of the gun. At 100 yards he claims to have killed 41 antelopes, four bison and many other wild animals. Annie Oakley used Remington target guns, and the company's muzzle loaders were used in the Civil War. The company also manufactured knives, cash registers, typewriters and bicycles. Although Remington is known for its high-quality firearms, it is also known for its high-quality finish on these rifles and shotguns. "We compare the finish on our parts to that of jewelry," stated Warren Hoffman, company chemist. "It must be perfect, with no blemishes or defects." For this reason, the company recently installed two black oxide finishing lines. The previous line looked as though it had been around since the early days of the company. "It was massive. Utility costs were high and maintenance was a million dollars a year," noted Joe Murray. Napco, Inc., Terryville, Connecticut, manufactured the two lines. The larger of the two lines is used to black oxide large parts, such as receivers and gun barrels. Small parts are finished on the smaller line, which has the capability to color heat-treated parts. The larger system is capable of running 7,000 parts in a 24-hr period. Presently it black oxides 5,500 to 6,000 parts per day. Prior to receiving the black oxide finish, steel parts are polished in one of three ways. Most parts are polished in a vibratory finishing system from Almco using ceramic media and then shot blasted with steel shot to produce a matte finish. Higher degree work is hand polished and then polished with ceramic media in the vibratory finisher. Others are only hand polished. The type of polishing depends on the final finish desired. After polishing, parts go through a two-stage alkaline cleaner, followed by a counterflow rinse. The first stage is a hot alkaline detergent cleaner running at 170F. Parts soak in each cleaner for approximately five min to remove buffing compounds, oils and shop oils After cleaning, parts enter a special conditioning bath that is critical to achieving a perfectly uniform finish. This strongly oxidizing bath is operated at 235F. The conditioning step was added to handle a particular gun model. This model is polished using lard oil and kerosene, which is smeared into the metal. To remove this, the conditioning step was added. However, Remington found that the conditioning step helped with all parts; therefore, all parts are subject to the conditioning step. An ambient rinse follows conditioning. Parts proceed directly into the 750 gal, 290F Pentrate Ultra black oxide bath, supplied by Heatbath Corporation, Springfield, Massachusetts, which also supplies the cleaners and conditioner. Time in tank averages 45 min. A wetting agent incorporated into the Pentrate Ultra minimizes dragout. Remington uses the liquid form of black oxide. It found that using liquid rather than powder enhanced safety, since workers did not have to shovel powder into a 290F bath. Also, the liquid bath generates considerably less sludge. The previous 2,000-gal black oxide tank was de-sludged every two weeks. Now it occurs monthly. This has saved on maintenance and chemical and hazardous waste disposal costs. Mr. Hoffman estimates that the new line has helped Remington decrease sludge by 80 pct, drop operating costs 70 pct, lower chemical costs 66 pct and decrease water use by 100 gpd. Parts run through two ambient rinses after the black oxide tank. The next step is Pentrate EE 2, a blackening step for silver soldered assemblies. The process blackens the silver solder and blends it with the original black oxide finish. Parts proceed through an ambient rinse. The final step is a soluble oil. Each morning this oil is heated to 150F for an hour to pasteurize it. This kills the bacteria that feed on the emulsifier system, splitting the oil from the emulsion and rendering the product useless. The oil provides corrosion protection and enhances the appearance of the blackened parts. After black oxide finishing, the parts move to assembly and/or the Remington Custom Shop. The custom shop is a work of art in itself. The floors and work stations are hardwood. The room is open, with large windows that provide plenty of natural light. Each artisan has been with the company for 20 years or more and is highly skilled in engraving and/or custom-assembling firearms. The new black oxide system earned Remington Arms an environmental award from the Mohawk Valley Engineering Executive Council. The award was for Outstanding Environmental Excellence for waste reduction and the company's elimination of solvent cleaning. Remington maintains excellence in all facets of its business, just as Eliphalet Remington did when he meticulously constructed the first firearm. The new black oxide line provides the high-quality finish Remington is known for. It also provides the added benefits of cost savings and a clean environment now and for the future.

But what really counts is time. There are many examples of people who take an active part in the finishing industry: lobbying their representatives, heading up various committees, serving on association boards. But there are many who go beyond their job and give their time to other causes. For example: There is a plater in the Milwaukee area who went out of his way to help a trusting immigrant who was trying to make a living operating an ethnic restaurant. This man had made a deal with an attorney, who helped him finance his restaurant. The immigrant was losing money and turned to this plater (his business neighbor) for help. This plater looked over the man's "books" and realized that this attorney was not doing right by his client. The Milwaukee shop owner helped the man rectify the situation and open a larger restaurant. The food is delicious, and there is a dinner named after the plater, The Big John. In Toledo, Ohio, there is a company that supplies painting equipment. The president is active in the Make a Wish Foundation. One of his "retired" employees, Ted Case, is also actively involved in the community. This company invited me to the Michigan 500 at the Michigan International Speedway. I eagerly accepted. Little did I know that the company had also invited about 20 handicapped children to visit the race track and meet the drivers. Oh, the faces of these kids as drivers such as Jeff Gordon, Ricky Rudd and Joe Nemechek stopped in the meeting room to sign autographs and talk to the children. They were excited as they held out their programs for the drivers to autograph. Mr. Case, the retired DeVilbiss employee, also treated these children to lunch and a beautiful poster signed by Jeff Gordon, one of the hottest Winston Cup drivers. I think Mr. Case got as big a charge out of it as the children did. I am sure there are many others who have gone beyond finishing to make a difference in the lives of others. These are just a few examples. I am thankful I work in an industry with people who care not only about their business, but the lives and issues that surround them and their families.

The effluent most finishers discharge is cleaner than the water that enters the plant. Just ask the finishers who "clean up" incoming water before using it in their finishing processes. The government likes to use the term pollution prevention. And all of these technologies are aimed at keeping pollution out of the air, water and land. But do finishers really pollute? There are not many anymore. The government, EPA, industry and citizens' groups such as the Sierra Club and Greenpeace have seen to that. Perhaps a better expression is resource conservation and recovery. When finishers lose metals to their waste treatment systems, they lose money. When they dump cleaners because they are overloaded with oils, they lose money. Therefore, most finishers have taken action to conserve these resources, recover as much as possible and reuse as much as possible. Most finishers have implemented the Best Available Control Technologies in their facilities. Still, finishers are badgered and threatened with new legislation and limits. That is why it is critical to support the Government Relations Committee, a joint effort of the American Electroplaters and Surface Finishers' Society (AESF), the National Association of Metal Finishers (NAMF) and the Metal Finishing Suppliers' Association (MFSA). Not only does this group require funds to operate, it needs information and statistics on the finishing industry to support its challenge of EPA and federal regulations that are oppressive and not founded on good scientific data. The NAMF and MFSA and AESF have donated money to the program, along with many of the AESF branches. One notable AESF branch is the Milwaukee Branch. This group, with the notable efforts of Jaime and John Maliszewski of Reliable Plating, John Lindstedt of Artistic Plating, Branch President Eric Olander of EPI, Inc. and several others, raised $31,000 to support the government relations program. To help obtain the data needed to support the committee's position and instill in legislators' minds the importance and viability of this industry, the three societies also established the Surface Finishing Market Research Board (SFMRB). The data collected can be used not only by the Government Relations Committee, but by industry, marketers and others with an interest in the surface finishing industry. Soon, the SFMRB will be sending out a survey on pretreatment. Please take the time to fill it out and return it. The survey will also appear on several web sites, including GardnerWeb. It is a simple survey, but the information will help you and the finishing industry tremendously.

There are many variables to consider when choosing the best cure oven for your application... By Kenneth N. Kraft Automotive Market Manager George Koch Sons, Inc. Evansville, Indiana The final step in the paint process is curing. The cure oven raises the product mass and coated material to a specified temperature and holds this temperature for a set time. Typically, 25 to 35 min at a set temperature is needed to achieve a minimum curing temperature for 20 minutes. Some product configurations trap liquids and may require zoned ovens. The oven exhaust, if insufficient to handle volatile materials released during curing, can negatively impact the cure and final part appearance. The amount of volatile material also depends on the product being used. The amount of exhaust and the type of heat source can affect product color. Poor exhaust and gas-fired ovens typically cause coating color to darken and/or yellow. The amount of color drift varies with product type. Prior to entering the cure oven, the product is usually cleaned, rinsed, dried, and coated. Time spent in the oven is determined by the coating suppliers, who specify the required time at a given temperature to thoroughly cure the coated product. However, line speed, product window size, hanging spacing and product weight/conveyor weight must be defined prior to designing a cure oven. Line Speed. Assume a production rate of 600 parts per hour. Assume each carrier holds two parts. Required number of carriers per hour 600 ¸ 2 = 300 carriers per min. Required number of carriers per min 300 ¸ 60 = 5 carriers per min. Assume a carrier spacing of 36 inches or 3 ft. Five carriers per min × 3 ft = 15 fpm. Example: Ware centers × required production = conveyor length 2 ft × 1,000/shift = 2,000 ft/shift Conveyor length, production time = conveyor speed 2,000 ft per shift/7.5 hrs per shift divided by 267 ft per hr/60 min per hr = 4.45 fpm To allow for variation in production requirements, it is advisable to set a maximum speed of about two times that calculation. A variable speed with a speed range of about 3:1 is the most common. Moving product/conveyor load weight. Product Ware Weight Unit Hanger (carrier weight) Conveyor Weight Design Conveyor Speed Conveyor speed × 60 = units/hr Ware center Units hr × Ware weight = _____lbs ware/hr Unit hanger weight × Units/hr = _____lbs hanger/hr Conveyor weight/ft (in lbs) × conveyor speed fpm × 60 = lbs conveyor/hr. When calculating oven heat loads, the above lbs/hr should be kept as a separate number due to different temperature rises and specific heat requirements. Oven heat load calculation. Parameters to consider when determining oven heat load include: radiation loss through enclosure panels; product heat absorption; conveyor/hanger heat absorption; heat losses through air seals or openings; and fresh air requirements for burners; continuous exhaust for insurance requirements; or coating material releases. Thermal heat DT (supply - recirculated). Supply air temperature minus oven design temperature of a gas-fired oven should be as follows: 125F will give ±10F in oven 100F will give ± 5F in oven Curing coatings varies. Infrared (gas and electric), radiant wall, conventional convection and high-velocity convection curing are some of the options. Most often direct-fired conventional convection curing is used. Infrared or radiant-wall designs are often incorporated for preheating only. A convection oven has five major components. Oven enclosure (shell) Heater unit Supply air system Recirculated air system Exhaust air system Oven Enclosure (shell) contains the environment necessary for the curing process, including a support structure; insulated panels (enclosure); and product openings/air seals. The oven support system should be designed to carry the enclosure weight and the product conveying system. Structural steel must be connected with slotted hole connections to allow for expansion. Insulated Panels (enclosure) contains the heat of the process. Panels 30 to 33 inches wide with fiber insulation (one inch of four-lb density insulation for every 100F) sandwiched between aluminized metal skins are used. The assembled panels are tongue-and-groove for easy installation. The outer skins are connected with formed metal channels. These channels form a through-metal condition, allowing significant heat loss at the joint. This panel joint can become too hot to touch, so the channel is slotted to reduce the area available for heat migration. This technique reduces joint temperature to less than 100F in a 450F oven, without losing the structural integrity of the channel. Corners present another problem with panel construction. At the edges of the oven, panels do not fit tightly together and leakage occurs. Void areas are filled with loose insulation and the areas are jacketed with sheet metal flashing. This is not sufficient to stop the escape of cure products that condense and stain oven walls. Continuous gaskets must be used to create a proper seal along horizontal seams. Personnel access must be provided. The door and hardware must seal the opening without using a positive latching device. Any panic hardware with positive latching features must allow the door to be opened from the inside. Locate access doors so that an exit is never more than 25 ft away. Oven doors with windows are easier to locate. A great source of oven problems is enclosure openings where products enter and exit. These openings are designed using minimal clearance for the ware. Bottom entry/exit designs make use of the natural sealing features of hot air and present no real problems. Openings in the sides of ovens require mechanical air seals to contain the environment. To seal an opening, it is best to draw hot air from the oven and force it back into the opening. For this to work, a significant velocity must be developed at the center of the opening. Additionally, the oven must run negative relative to the production environment. These two requirements draw factory air into the oven. This pressurization is relieved by exhausting the enclosure, resulting in a considerable source of heat loss. An alternative to traditional construction methods is an oven module. When the design allows for shipping, 20-ft-long completely assembled sections of the oven can be fabricated. This construction includes all-welded interiors that eliminate areas for dirt to collect; steel buried in the panels to reduce interior surface area; fewer joints with through metal for less heat loss; and speed and ease of assembly at the customer's factory. Despite the many positive features, these ovens are rarely practical because of their configuration. Heater units. The second system at work in an oven is the heater unit. The heater generates the energy for curing and begins the distribution of energy. The most significant components of the heater are the burner, supply fan and filters. To properly size heater equipment, a detailed heat load must be calculated. Energy losses for the ware load, conveyor load, enclosure and exhaust requirements must be considered. These losses, expressed in Btu's/hr, are used for selecting the burner and corresponding electrical devices necessary for burner control. The burner is most often a direct-flame device that provides the energy for curing. The heat load calculation also provides information for selecting an oven supply fan. The heat required to maintain good oven temperature is delivered by heating the supply air to no more than 100F above the oven operating temperature and distributing this air to the oven. The fan volume must be expanded for the elevated temperatures. The supply fan should turn over the oven volume about two times a minute. Because the fan is a constant volume device, the fan motor is sized for cold starts to avoid overloading. This provides an oven temperature profile better than plus or minus 10F throughout the enclosure. Many heater units have filtration systems to continuously clean the oven environment. Filter efficiency varies with the application, but the types modified for the elevated temperatures used to filter final makeup are most effective. Filters require much lower velocities than in normal heater units. When filters are used, heater unit size must be increased. Oven filters continuously clean the air and, as a result, load very slowly. It is not necessary to pre-filter high efficiency filters. Sometimes the products of combustion are not compatible with the coating. In these cases, indirect-fired heater units are an option. These use air-to-air heat exchangers and may require one third more energy to operate. Supply Air System. Another problem occurring when the products of the cure and combustion combine and come in contact with a direct flame is the production of NOx. When this becomes a problem, it is overcome by introducing large amounts of fresh air into the heater. This lowers the temperature of the flame-heated air to a point where NOx is not produced. This, like the indirect oven, is applied at a significant cost of energy. As the heater unit discharges the supply air, it is directed into the oven supply system. The purpose of the supply system is to deliver and distribute the energy developed in the heater unit. The rectangular supply duct is constructed of aluminized metal. For proper operation, velocities in the duct should not exceed 2,500 fpm. This assures good laminar flow and good temperature control. Supply ducts should be along all walls and between every other conveyor run to eliminate cold spots. Recirculated air systems.The recirculating system returns oven air to the heater unit so that energy is continually added to the oven. This is accomplished using the duct with the supply fan to create a negative pressure condition within the enclosure. The oven air naturally migrates to the areas of low pressure, where it is captured in the duct system and returned to the heater. Recirculating duct is fabricated in much the same manner as the supply duct. The duct is designed for slightly lower velocities. The velocity in the duct is held at 2,000 fpm and openings are 20-25 pct greater than the supply. It is poor design to use the recirculating duct to provide control over the oven environment. The influence of suction pressure is negligible, even at short distances from the source. While air naturally moves to the areas of lower pressure, this movement cannot be easily controlled. It is better to place a small amount of recirculation in the hottest part of the oven and let the supply air do the work. This assures that the design requirements will be maintained. Exhaust air system. Every oven must be exhausted. Exhausts create a negative environment so that air seals operate properly and remove VOCs and other cure products from the oven. Additionally, the exhaust purges the oven prior to start-up. The requirement for purge is to change the enclosure atmosphere four times in approximately 20 min prior to ignition. The main job of the exhaust is to maintain a safe environment. A good rule of thumb is to exhaust 10,000 cu ft of air (expanded for elevated temperatures) for every gal of solvent driven off in the oven. This assures the oven atmosphere will be maintained below the lower explosion limit of the solvent with a safety factor of four. Exhaust also eliminates smoke build-up. Smoke is produced when curing some electrocoatings and powders. The exhaust requirement here is best recommended by the coating supplier. The flexibility of convection curing keeps it popular with today's finishers, despite pressures to increase quality and reduce the space required for paint shops. A properly designed and installed convection oven requires little attention relative to pretreatment and application processes. It runs effectively with simple controls. It can be combined with other curing methods. Filtration or indirect firing can be added to improve quality. Because the exhaust can be controlled so well, abating oven gases is reasonably achieved. To conserve on factory space, ovens can be elevated, located outside or on building roofs. Typical oven maintenance and inspection schedule. A typical weekly maintenance schedule would include inspection of the following: Flame failure detection system; Ignitor and burner operation; Burner air filter; Burner blower impeller cleanliness; Burner blower motor cleanliness; Heater shell interior cleanliness; and Fan lubrication. A monthly schedule would include a check of the following: Fuel safety shutoff valves; Fan and air flow interlocks; Time delay switch settings (purge); Conveyor interlocks; Limit switches; Explosion relief latches; Gas drip leg; High and low fuel pressure interlocks; Interior ductwork cleanliness; and Interior oven cleanliness. Annual inspection and maintenance schedules should include: Ignitor and burner components; Combustion air supply system; Flame failure system components; Piping and wiring components; Combustion control system; Instrument calibration; Automatic fire checks; and Operating sequence tests. The understanding of oven system requirements will lead to a successful implementation when the end user, coating and equipment suppliers work as partners in developing the oven curing system right for you.

By Kenneth B. Colbert Business Director Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Princeton, New Jersey Completing a coating removal project poses many challenges: time constraints, environmental and safety concerns, regulatory compliance and increasing labor costs are just a few. Some companies, however, are finding that these factors are bearing better, cheaper, faster and safer solutions. The automotive industry is among those known for such challenges. Recently, a major Midwestern automobile manufacturer sought a better solution to a coating build-up problem at its assembly plant. The manufacturer uses carriers to convey leaf springs through the manufacturing process. The various-sized leaf springs are used to connect the car body to the rear drive axle. The carriers (similar to paint hooks) are 12 inches long, weigh approximately five lbs and resemble large tuning forks. They are welded from 3/8-inch steel rod. The autophoretic rust-preventive coating applied to the springs during manufacturing builds up on the carriers. This build-up can cause coating residue or parts to fall off the carriers, disrupting plant production and impacting operating costs. With more than 1,700 carriers, effective cleaning is a significant concern. Previously, the carriers were soaked in an acid bath, then manually pounded with hammers to remove the built-up coating. This method did not remove the coating completely, resulting in rapid buildup return. Furthermore, the labor intensive coating removal method prompted the manufacturer to delay cleaning until absolutely necessary. When cleaning was required, plant personnel would take 500 carriers out of service on weekends and replace them with spares. Waste disposal and its associated costs were also an issue. The autophoretic coating combines organic polyvinyladene chloride or PVDC (similar to plastic food wrap) with trace amounts of hexavalent chromium. As a result, the mechanical removal process produced waste containing chromium, causing it to fail the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). Proper disposal of hazardous waste is significantly more costly than non-hazardous waste and requires extensive recordkeeping. In evaluating alternative methods, pyrolysis (high-temperature burn-off) was not an option, as the PVDC can generate carcinogenic compounds when removed this way. On the other hand, typical blasting methods created the same disposal concerns as the manual removal method. Several months ago, however, the manufacturer turned the cleaning challenge over to Geostrip Systems, Inc. of Livonia, Michigan, a certified contractor of the ARMEXTM Cleaning and Coating Removal Systems. Developed by Church & Dwight Co., Inc., this system uses a patented baking-soda-based technology to effectively clean and remove coatings and built-up residues. Now, the customer outsources the cleaning process to the contractor, who cleans all 1,700 hooks quarterly in a four-week period, with no production interruptions and no plant personnel involvement. Geostrip Systems uses the Blast Cabinet Process, a containment system featuring either a Model 13P or 12X delivery device mounted on a mobile unit. The equipment is powered by a 185 cfm compressor. The operator uses a hand-held, No. 6 Hi-Pro nozzle and baking-soda-based Maintenance Formula XL with a rinse accelerator at blast pressures of 60 to 70 psi. Approximately 1,000 lbs of media is used to clean the entire stock of 1,700 hooks. The result is a faster, more effective and environmentally sensible alternative to the plant's previous soak-and-pound method. The paint hooks are cleaned down to bare metal. Also, due to the speed and ease of this process, the hooks are maintained at a higher level of cleanliness, satisfying the customer and eliminating production problems related to coating build-up on the hooks. In addition to these benefits, the system has solved the disposal concerns related to the cleaning process. With the previous mechanical cleaning method, the process residue failed the TCLP test for chromium at 18 mg/liter (the limit is 5.0 mg/liter). By contrast, the waste stream produced by the replacement tests at 2.3 mg/liter. Therefore, the waste does not need to be treated as hazardous and can be disposed in conventional landfills. This has reduced waste disposal costs by a factor of 10. In addition, the customer does not need to track the waste as part of RCRA record-keeping requirements. This is a significant time and cost saving as the cleaning process generates approximately 1,000 pounds of dry, nonhazardous waste for every 1,700 carriers cleaned. Cleaning Media Profile. The blast media is effective for paint removal due to its soft crystalline structure, which makes it an ideal mild abrasive. The soft, friable crystals break down on contact with the substrate, resulting in a more gentle cleaning process, even for fragile surfaces such as glass and brick. The process may be used on iron, steel, galvanized metal, ornamental brass and copper, aluminum, chrome and composite materials. One advantage of a soft abrasive is the added capability to selectively remove coatings layer-by-layer. As a result, the operator can often remove the paint while leaving the underlying coatings intact. The system was originally developed to safely clean and strip the Statue of Liberty. The cleaning media is non-toxic and non-hazardous as defined by EPA and OSHA, so it eliminates many safety and environmental restrictions. The media also poses no special disposal concerns and may even be beneficial as a buffer for wastewater treatment. Unlike plain baking soda, the cleaning media has a larger, uniform grain size along with flow agents and rinse accelerators for improved performance. This helps keep the media free-flowing. It flows better and can be stored for long periods without handling problems. In addition, some formulations have rinsing agents to help facilitate cleanup. Equipment Profile. When powered by an industrial air compressor, the media delivery system operates on 20 to 100 psi of air pressure and may be used to clean wet or dry depending on containment needs. It uses an atomized external water stream for media control, and has a flow control system that precisely and consistently meters small amounts of media (½ to 3-½ lbs/min) required for optimal performance. The rate of paint removal varies according to the equipment, media and substrate; however, a typical removal rate is between one and two sq ft per min. The baking-soda-based process effectively solved the coating build-up problem for this Midwest manufacturer and saved significant time and money in plant operating and disposal costs. In the automotive industry, the system is ideal for cleaning and stripping a variety of other types of carriers, such as those used to convey auto bodies and parts through dip and spray processes. It is among a new generation of technologies for better, faster, cheaper, and safer ways to successfully meet everincreasing manufacturing and maintenance challenges.

Stiffening environmental regulations have led many manufacturers to change operating practices to improve air quality. In late 1994, Republic Container, a Nitro, West Virginia-based manufacturer of steel drums, switched from solvent- to water-borne coatings to lower the amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted. The drums are used for shipping and storing chemicals, lubricants and other liquid or powder materials. "We were meeting the 4.3 lb/gal VOC restriction enforced by West Virginia's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)," said Jim McKnight, Republic's president. "But we knew the department would lower that number in the near future. Our goal was to reduce VOCs below 3.5 lb/gal to stay ahead of the game. And the only way to do that was to switch to water-borne coatings." Meeting Quality Requirements. Republic worked with long-time coating material supplier Jamestown Paint to develop a water-borne coating system that would meet the company's needs and capabilities. The switch involved several challenges. "One of our primary concerns was quality," said Mr. McKnight. "Typically, solvent-borne coatings offer a higher gloss, resulting in a better looking container. Water-borne coatings often look faded and dull and do not adhere to cold-rolled steel as well as solvent-borne coatings. This often causes a streaking effect." The water-borne coating also had to resist damage from chemicals and other lubricants stored in the containers. The 55-gal steel drums are coated primarily with automatic spray machines and some hand-held spray guns. Republic's plant personnel wanted the new water-borne coating to be compatible with existing spray equipment. Also, one of the drum's three panels often is sprayed a different color than the other two, making it necessary to find a way to prevent overspray. It required more than one year to develop a water-borne coating that worked with the existing spray equipment. Republic only had to replace a few nozzles. To avoid overspray, coatings were formulated so that any overspray from the second color was absorbed by the first color. Environmental Improvements. Mr. McKnight stated, "The water-borne coating performs just as well as the coating we were using. And we have virtually eliminated hazardous chemicals. Once we trained our employees to work with the new coating, they found that water-borne was easier to mix and use." After testing the water-borne coating on site and in the laboratory, a formulation was developed with a viscosity of approximately 55 sec on a No. 4 Ford cup and a flash point of 77F. VOCs were reduced to about 2.8 lbs/gal. Economic Improvements. Although the raw materials needed to produce water-borne coatings are more expensive than those for solvent-borne coatings, the water-borne product is more cost-effective in the end. In 1995, Republic saved more than $10,000 in paint costs. "When you compare the cost of water to the cost of solvents, we are saving about $1,000 per month," said Mr. McKnight. "And we have eliminated hazardous disposal costs. By not having to haul waste twice a month, we have also minimized the need to purchase waste drums, which can cost $300 to $500 apiece." Mr. McKnight added that water-borne coatings are baked at lower temperatures and for shorter periods of time, reducing energy costs. "Water-based coatings are the wave of the future," he said. "By making the switch now, we're ready for tougher EPA regulations down the road."

Many large companies in the Michigan area are evaluating their captive product finishing operations and considering a move to the Kalamazoo Plating Center (KPC). KPC is a 550,000-sq-ft common facility that provides a proactive solution to the array of cost and quality control issues that confront captive shops. There is an increasing trend for manufacturers with multiple captive shops to consider alternatives for their finishing requirements. Because of high operating and labor costs and escalating environmental liabilities, many manufacturers are moving away from captive operations. Some companies have decided to phase-out finishing operations in favor of job shops. Others are consolidating and improving operations as a way of maintaining future control over quality, scheduling and costs. Economies of scale. Manufacturers interested in consolidating and modernizing their captive operations report that a centralized finishing facility reduces the need for large capital investment. The center also provides for fixed costs and economies of scale in commodity pricing that a stand-alone facility may not be able to achieve. By aggregating demand, the facility negotiates and contracts for bulk-rate services. These are passed on to each tenant at 100 cents on the dollar. For example, one prospective tenant found a $150,000 annual saving in the cost of electricity. Other discounts on goods and services range from insurance to chemicals. Improved productivity. Manufacturers also report a need to update their technology and increase efficiency. In many cases, manufacturers reported that improvements in production were necessary to reach new quality standards. Pollution control and prevention systems were often cited as needing major overhauls. KPC provides modern and efficient production space specifically designed to accommodate most finishing operations. All leased premises include a six-head drain manifold stubbed out of each facility. Each tenant's electric service is sized to the shop's specific requirements. And each has segregated wastewater outlets leading to the on-site waste treatment facility operated by KPC. In addition, each shop will have high-efficiency, industrial lighting and heating systems. Each unit will be environmentally isolated from its neighbors, and each will ship and receive through its own dock. Centralized waste treatment. The cost of installing, upgrading and maintaining a pollution control system escalates due to increasing regulations, environmental management overhead and disposal costs. In some instances, system additions or replacements are requisite to accommodate process changes. KPC relieves these pressures by capitalizing and operating a full-service wastewater treatment facility to serve each of its tenants. Each tenant is metered separately and shares use of the common treatment facility on a pay-per-use basis. As part of the tenants' single payment, KPC assumes responsibility for environmental management and reporting, system operation and maintenance and solid-waste disposal. The wastewater treatment system handles a broad range of contaminants and will employ a continuous flow model, capable of treating a throughput of 1.5 million gpd, seven days a week. The treated water will be discharged to the Kalamazoo Water Reclamation Plant in accordance with regulatory requirements. Once each tenant's waste stream has cleared its outflow meter, KPC is the responsible party under federal and state regulations. Established protocols ensure the KPC will never be out of compliance, and backup systems ensure that it will never be out of service. The entire system is also insured. Total cost and quality improvement. By off loading pollution control and other operating overhead and accessing the below-market cost platform, captive shops are freed to implement their core mission: increased productivity and total quality management. At the same time, liabilities are reduced and the parent retains complete control over future costs and schedules.

By Beverly A. Graves Editor Most days an empty chair is all that sits behind Bob McDowell's desk. The owner of McDowell Enterprises, Elkhart, Indiana, is a busy man. Not only does he own a successful plating shop, but he is president of the National Association of Metal Finishers (NAMF) and last year managed his wife's mayoral campaign. The plating job shop came first. It started with Mr. McDowell's grandfather, Chester McDowell. In 1913, Grandfather McDowell worked in the plating department of Haynes-Apperson, a Kokomo automobile manufacturer. At that time he joined the American Electroplaters and Surface Finishers Society (AESF), then known at the American Electroplaters Society. In 1925 he moved to Elkhart to join the Chicago Telephone Supply (CTS) Company where he became plating foreman. Some of the telephone parts required gold plating. Because gold plating was expensive, CTS took on outside work to keep the tanks in production. This included fish hooks for Hildebrandt. This became a big business. And eventually, Grandfather McDowell decided there was enough work to warrant a separate finishing shop. In 1947 Chester McDowell opened South Side Plating in Elkhart. Chester McDowell's three sons, William, Robert and Richard, all were involved in the plating company. However, after Grandfather McDowell's death in 1968, Richard and Robert (Bob McDowell's father) stayed at South Side and William started his own business, McDowell Enterprises. Needless to say, Bob McDowell grew up in the plating business. "I may have chrome in my blood," he joked. "Although I've never had it tested." He worked summers at South Side Plating while attending Indiana University. "I thought I would get my degree and leave the plating business behind me," he noted. He tried. After earning his degree in 1973, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia. Here he worked in the insurance business, and met his wife, Carol, because she witnessed an accident involving a driver Mr. McDowell's company insured. The couple moved to Knoxville, Tennessee and lived there until they felt rumblings from up north. South Side Plating was faltering and concerned about looming environmental legislation. Mr. and Mrs. McDowell decided to move to Elkhart in 1979 and buy the company. They also bought McDowell Enterprises in 1980 and consolidated the two companies under the one name. "It was a gamble," Mr. McDowell admitted. "But it has paid off for us." The plating shop provides copper, nickel, chromium and electroless gold plating for a number of customers. One major customer manufactures musical band instruments. Mr. McDowell estimates that his company hard chromium plates more than half of the world's slide trombones. The trombone shaft is plated with hard chromium for wear resistance. Even Yamaha has been to the facility to try to duplicate the finish. McDowell Enterprises also plates other band instruments in addition to polishing and buffing them to a high sheen. The band instruments require a high-quality finish, so plating baths are regularly tested to keep them at peak performance. The company uses Ashland Chemical Company for all its plating chemicals. Another major customer is still the fish hook manufacturer that started it all. "We do hundreds of thousands of fishing lures. I have tried them, and they do not work for me. But I am not a good fisherman. I have heard they work well for walleye fishing in Lake Huron," Mr. McDowell advised. Other customers include fire safety equipment manufacturers, die casters and the many mobile home manufacturers in the area. These manufacturers need plated molds for manufacturing the siding used on many recreational vehicles. The company has all manual lines, both rack and barrel. It specializes in small quantity, short runs because of this. "This is a traditional plating shop," Mr. McDowell said. "Nothing fancy. Just high-quality, traditional plating." When he bought the family business, Bob McDowell knew he would need help running the shop. He received that help by joining both the AESF and the NAMF. "I needed guidance managing a business. I was young to be running a firm. The key for me was networking with other people, learning their mistakes and what worked for them," he said. Mr. McDowell worked his way through the offices of the Indiana NAMF and then through offices on the national level, to his present position as president. "This has been a year of change for the Association (NAMF)," said Mr. McDowell. The Association has changed its management group, its lobbying firm and its insurance administrator for health and group health. However, the transitions have gone well because they were planned out in advance. While all this was going on, his wife, company co-owner and environmental manager, ran for mayor of Elkhart. Mrs. McDowell's interest in politics resulted from her position in the company. Daily she deals with local and state government officials. She learned about the city's infrastructure and its POTW. She learned its weaknesses and had ideas on improving it. She authored the groundwater ordinance for Elkhart County. She is currently working on obtaining $200,000 worth of scrubbers and equipment to handle the measly seven lbs of chromium the company emits annually. While serving as a city council representative, Mrs. McDowell felt she could better serve her city as mayor. With the support of the police, 1,500 volunteers and her husband, she ran for office. Unfortunately, she lost by a mere 148 votes. "Carol and I could not have done any of this without our plant manager, Gerry," Mr. McDowell admitted. Gerry Krause has been with the company for 20 years, longer than Mr. McDowell. Not only does she help keep the business running, but she manages the business when Mr. McDowell is acting as NAMF president or his wife's aide. In other words, when the chair behind the desk is empty.

Lauren needs a little spending money, so she drives through the automatic teller and takes out $20. Rob calls a business associate about an account, only he ends up talking with a computer through the keypad on his telephone. Technology can be fun, quick, convenient, beneficial and helpful. But I have found that it is no replacement for a handshake, a smile or a face-to-face conversation with a person. There is no substitute for the actual experience. Bob McDowell, president of the National Association of Metal Finishers (NAMF) and owner of McDowell Enterprises, Elkhart, Indiana, learned this early in his finishing career. He joined NAMF and the American Electro-platers and Surface Finishers Society (AESF) soon after acquiring his father's plating shop. He says he learned all the pitfalls and successes of running a plating facility by networking within these associations. Why do the NAMF, AESF and the Metal Finishing Suppliers Association (MFSA) organize a Day on Capitol Hill every September? Because it is more effective to meet your representatives and discuss issues relating to the finishing industry when you are looking them straight in the eye. It personalizes that three-inch stack of paper (legislation) when the representatives can see a person or a small business attached to it. Not only is personal contact good for business, but it is good for your health as well. According to an article from Creating Community Anywhere, psychologist Robert Ornstein and physician David Sobel state that human beings evolved as social animals, and our brains are programmed to connect us with others in order to improve our chances of survival. Interaction with the social world of others enlarges our focus, enhances our ability to solve problems and makes us less vulnerable to disease. Getting together through association meetings, conferences, plant tours or consultations improves finishers' chance of survival. Interacting with others in the finishing industry enhances your ability to solve your problems and maybe help others solve theirs. You could discuss a part discoloration problem on the telephone, but wouldn't it be better if you could show the person what you are talking about? I realize computers, telephones and electronic mail are important and necessary. But, as I said before, there is no substitute for a handshake or a face-to-face conversation; just as there is no substitute for seeing the Grand Canyon or the space shuttle Endeavor blasting off or a child taking its first steps.

Rotary Lift manufactures automotive car hoists and related equipment. According to Essam Higazy, manufacturing manager of Rotary Lift, "Sending parts out forced us to carry a higher inventory of raw materials and components. By installing the blackening system, blackening larger quantities of components in-house became a major convenience for our just-in-time program," Mr. Higazy reported. The BC 100 system, from Birchwood Casey of Minneapolis, Minnesota, is fully engineered with the capacity to finish large parts or multiples of smaller parts quickly. It has eight, 100-gal-capacity tanks, each measuring 24 by 40 by 28 � inches deep. The line allows Rotary Lift to blacken castings, forgings, metal stampings and a large variety of other metals with an attractive finish that provides strong protection against corrosion. According to verified testing, the finish withstands up to 200 hr neutral salt spray (ASTM B 117) or several hundred hr humidity (ASTM D 1748), depending on the sealant used. The finish itself has overall uniformity, even on those components with complex shapes and configurations, such as those finished by Rotary Lift. The process finish does not affect part dimension or material hardness. The company found the process easy to prepare and to work with because the solution is odorless, non-caustic, non-splattering and only mildly acidic. It is designed for long bath life without the need for routine dumping. Solution monitoring and control are simple using a color change test that indicates proper concentration level. The system fit in well with the productivity and just-in-time needs at Rotary Lift because the total process time is only 10 to 12 min. The process runs as follows: Clean at 150F, four to six min Rinse in clear water, 20 sec Second rinse, 20 sec Activate at 120F, two to three min Rinse, 20 sec Blacken at room temperature, one min Rinse, 20 sec Seal out corrosion, one to two min No special venting is needed with the process, reducing the initial investment cost. Without the noxious fumes associated with hot processes, Rotary Lift employees enjoy greater worker comfort. An important feature of Rotary Lift's blackening system is the ion exchange that integrates effluent treatment within the process for zero drain pollution. The ion exchange feature incorporates a special resin filter assembly to remove all contaminants from the rinse tanks. Treatment in this manner completely eliminates discharge of the rinse waters.

A golf car is subjected to a variety of hazards that can be detrimental to its finish. Stones chip away at the protective coating, allowing rain, mud and fertilizers to attack the base metal. Long exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays can bleach the paint. And there is always the threat of stray golf balls and hard driving by enthusiastic and sometimes frustrated golfers. Providing a durable finish is a priority for E-Z-GO Textron, the world'slargest manufacturer of golf cars. The company, located in Augusta,Georgia,produces nearly 400 gas and electric vehicles per day, of which more than320 aregolf cars. The balance is utility vehicles and personnel carriers for golfcoursemaintenance and general industrial uses. In total, the companymanufactures morethan 40 types of vehicles. To help maintain its market leadership, the company redesigned its golfcar,with a planned introduction of January 1994. Richard Jefferies, teamleader forprocess planning said, "We developed the new product from the ground up,startingwith a universal frame for both gas and electric vehicles. At first, wesimplywere going to upgrade the finishing line to accommodate the new golf car. But we saw an opportunity to design atrueworld-class manufacturing operation." There were several reasons to change the production line. "First, said Mr.Jefferies, "we were already at our maximum production capacity. The newlinecould be designed to reduce material handling and speed production. "We also wanted better corrosion protection than we were getting. Andwe weregetting close to our VOC limits. We also needed to add capacity to paintseveraldifferent vehicles. A new painting system could be designed to meet ourfuturerequirements." After reviewing different coatings, E-Z-GO chose powder coating forboth thebody panels and frames. The company selected Milbank, Kansas City,Missouri, todesign the production line and supply the washers and ovens, and NordsonCorporation, Amherst, Ohio, to supply the powder coating system. Key to the new system is more than three miles of power-and-freeconveyor,which snakes its way from fabrication to finishing to assembly. "Insteadofmanually transporting parts from the welding area to the finishing line,we nowhang parts on the line, and they are conveyed directly through production.Withthe previous system, it took almost two days to get parts finished and totheassembly line. Now, finished parts get to the assembly line in about threehours," said Mr. Jefferies. All parts are painted with a powder primer, then a color top coat. E-Z-GOusesa new series of powder coatings developed by Evtech, a division ofEastmanChemical Company. The coatings, called the Evlast 5440 series, have anacrylic/polyester urethane chemistry. The coatings were developed toprovide theflexibility and weatherability required for the demanding golf carenvironment. According to Chip LaPole, E-Z-GO manufacturing engineer, the powder notonlymeets requirements for appearance and gloss, but gives a durable,scratch-resistant finish. The requirement for the salt-spray test is 500hrs, andthe powder exceeds 2,000 hours. "The key to good corrosion resistance," added Mr. Jefferies, "is in thepretreatment." All galvanized and welded parts are conveyed through aMilbankseven-stage washer using zinc phosphate and chrome rinse from NovamaxTechnologies. Welded parts are conveyed through a pickling solution priortoentering the washer. Five Nordson Excel 2000� powder spray booths are located in twoenvironmentallycontrolled rooms. One room contains separate booths for the primer andblackpaint; the second room has two reclaim booths and one non-reclaim boothforcolors. The spray booths are equipped with Versa-Sprayr guns and Versa-ScreenTMbooth and gun controls. The booth controls monitor major operating parameters, including dewpoint andpowder level. Controls trigger guns off between parts to minimizerecycling ofoversprayed powder. "The controls help us get the coverage uniformity weneed forappearance and corrosion protection," said Mr. La Pole. The company reclaims primer and black, which are used on the frames. Italsoreclaims the four most popular colors, which are beige, gray, white andlightgreen. Other colors are sprayed to waste. A typical color change takes about 20 min, but Mr. Jefferies said thetime isnot a major factor. "The way the production runs, we are painting in threeboothsat one time. We change color in the fourth booth while we are runningproductionin the others. This makes the color-change time insignificant toproduction." E-Z-GO has realized several benefits with the new powder coatingsystem. "Paintefficiency is 98 pct in the reclaim booths," said Mr. LaPole. "Even when wefactor in the non-reclaim colors, paint efficiency is 90 pct." The powder system and new manufacturing process have reduced thereject rate,which has translated into labor savings. With the liquid system thecompany hadfive full-time employees who reworked parts. That has been reduced toone personwho spends about six hours per day on rework. This is with a 30 pctincrease inthe number of cars produced." There are also labor savings on the finishing line itself. The liquid lineneeded 18 people to operate. The powder system needs 12 people, reducingdirectlabor by about 35 pct. The new E-Z-GO golf car has been very successful in the marketplace,and thepowder-coated finish is used as a selling point. Ron Skenes, manager,marketingservices, says, "We have a new product and a new process. We promote ourgolfcar's new body style, better manufacturing, and its longer lasting, more durable finish."

(Southfield, Michigan) The Automotive Environment As the world economy moves into a growth phase, the U.S. automotive industry is continuing a restructuring process that will have a major impact on all the participants. The restructuring of the industry revolves around two major factors. The first factor is the competitive requirement to create, produce and deliver quality vehicles more rapidly while using extended enterprise facilities located around the world. The second factor is the global market influence on the industry which is providing new growth markets while at the same time causing production facilities to strain to meet the increased demand. Keeping plants located around the world working in harmony is an added complexity to an already complex industry. The easy use of technology by the line organizations can play a strong role in uniting the design and production process. The goal of the supplier in the global enterprise is to fit into the OEM business processes of today, and those in the future, as seamlessly as the internal and domestic plants. But no one can predict the specific changes in the technology or the business processes that will be required by the automotive industry. One approach to the problem is to use technology that can easily adapt to changes in both business practice (in the OEM and global supplier) and in technology itself. It is important to build a sound foundation that can balance the goals of the business process, the technology, and the organization. Business Process Goals An identification of the key business processes that must operate correctly to maintain and improve overall operating effectiveness. These business processes will become the focal point for the application of the appropriate monitoring or control technology. An implementation strategy that concentrates both on the specific business purpose to be accomplished and uses the transportable technical building blocks (i.e. collect move, manage, analyze and process information). If common technical building blocks are used, future applications will have more time to focus on the business function improvement rather than the supporting technology infrastructure. This will, over time, allow future applications to be implemented 20-30 times faster than using traditional techniques. Technology Goals: A global network that allows for the communication of the key automotive information elements, (i.e. geometry, image, numbers, words, video/voice) within the supplier organization and between the supplier and the OEM. An information model that defines all the information required to monitor the business operation for decision making. Experience is that approximately 400-500 elements comprise the information model for most manufacturing plants. This model must be shared between the supplier and the OEM to ensure that a common meaning of the information elements are shared throughout the enterprise. A set of easy to use analysis tools that integrate all types of information. Organization Goals A line organization that owns the responsibility for success, while the technical community provides accurate information. The technical group also supports the use of powerful, easy-to-use analysis tools, along with core business process applications (planning, scheduling, administrative etc.). An empowered organization focused on making improvements to the business. Access to appropriate information can never be allowed to interfere with this process. Successful improvements to the business can result only as far as the weakest of the three elements (technology, process, organization) allows. Of the three elements, it is the business process requirements that drive the technology and organizational requirements. The Automotive Business Process The business functions involved in providing a car to a customer can be divided into five major process components. These components (Figure 1)consist of: Product and Manufacturing Engineering Centralized activities (Research, Material Scheduling, Marketing, etc.) Manufacturing Assembly Dealers Each of these components is comprised of innumerable elements that all tie together in the overall process of producing a car. The business elements that generate the design and manufacturing process for a new car are represented on the left side of the model. The elements that are involved in producing a car and delivering it to the customer are found on the right side of the chart. To improve the overall automotive process, each of the elements must work in harmony. Very few gains are made if one element of the overall process is world class, and the gains of that process can not be passed on through the surrounding elements. In the future, the business drivers of the domestic automotive companies will increase the pressure to be: faster time to market improving quality to the customer continuously improving the development and production process building quality products in an "agile" fashion. As the supplier base becomes more geographically distant, the job of keeping the individual process elements and the people of the extended enterprise in harmony will become much more difficult. Technology in the Automotive Business Process The role of technology in this environment is to provide an integrated framework that will easily allow all forms of car-related information to flow through all the business elements in the process. Technology alone can solve very few business problems. Business objectives are met when the technology is combined with the appropriate business process, and supported by the appropriate organization. In a global business model where continuous improvement by all the participants is mandatory, the technology framework must be easy to use, multi-lingual, comprehensive in the type of information accessed, and support changes to the business process with no change required to the underlying technology. The net result must be an information network that makes the world-wide participants feel as though they are co-located. Technology Strategy The process of developing and building a car requires five fundamental types of information: Geometry (the mathematical model used to design the car) Image (the two dimensional drawings used to describe parts, machines, tools, plant layouts, etc.) Numbers (measurement of performance) Words (fundamental office communication) Multi-media (video and voice information). With respect to computer technology, each of these different types of information require the same types of technical "building blocks" to allow them to be used in the automotive process. These building blocks provide the ability to: Capture Information Move Information Manage Information Access Information Process Information The business/technical strategy in the complex global automotive business process that will provide the maximum impact to the business (business process control, empowered people) is to implement information systems with as many common building blocks as possible. This approach provides the greatest flexibility in utilizing whatever "easy-to-use" tools might be available, and provides the greatest flexibility to accommodate changes in the business or the technology. Automotive Business/Technology Strategy This strategy consists of two major systems process elements. One is the definition of an automotive "Information Model" and the second is to provide a cadre of powerful tools to allow direct access to that information by the line organization. A "roadmap" for the evolutionary implementation of an integrated supplier information network depicting how the five major technologies (Geometry, Image, Numbers, Words, Multi-media) fit together is shown in Figure 2. The horizontal axis of the figure depicts the major functions of any automotive business (i.e., Engineering, Planning, Administration, Manufacturing Support and Manufacturing). Engineering in this chart represents the functions of Product and Process design along with the Engineering and Engineering data management. The Planning function represents the operations analysis functions required to understand the business environment and to set direction. Administration represents the functions of Accounting, Financial Analysis and Manufacturing Performance analysis. The Manufacturing support function depicts the plant support functions such as Purchasing and Production Control. The Manufacturing column represents the operations that actually produce and distribute products. The vertical axis of the chart represents the time requirement for performing the business functions. Those activities performed in the upper part of the chart are performed in hours to weeks; those activities in the middle are performed in minutes to hours; and those activities in the lower portion are performed in seconds to minutes. The blocks on the chart show where the various types of technologies would typically be found in the automotive extended enterprise. The chart depicts two main themes: No single technology is appropriate for performing all the functions required by the automotive extended enterprise. For example, it is appropriate to use a relational data base and powerful end user tools for end user analysis applications in the area of decision support. It is not appropriate, however, to use a relational data base for machine control applications used on the plant floor. Therefore, specific technologies and their different methods of implementation should be used to support different functions in the automotive business. The integrating element that ties the technology and the business drivers together is the automotive product information model. New techniques for identifying what information is important to the business process have become available that now allow many "personalized" capabilities to be implanted. The model provides flexibility to make changes in the business process and provides a vehicle to communicate with common information. It is important to separate the process of providing information from the process of using the information. Organization Because of the nature of the technology available, most systems used in the automotive industry tended to use the methodology associated with the transaction or process control type of application. These systems provided benefit to the automotive enterprise by doing exactly what they were designed to do. Unfortunately, they did not communicate very well with the other application systems, they were not easy to use, and they were not easy to modify. As a result the information that described the operation of the business was owned by the technical community. Access to new information is difficult within the enterprise negating potential improvements that can be gained through the entire workforce. These improvements can be significant because the individuals performing the specific operational processes understand that process better than anyone else and are most able to suggest improvements. The operational people comprise the most significant percentage of the workforce so it is easier to get 100,000 one-percent improvements than it is to get one 100,000-percent improvement. The triangle diagram (Figure 3) represents the system functions most commonly required by manufacturing systems, (i.e. collecting data, modeling the data, end user tools to easily analyze the data, and using the data in planning and scheduling systems). The characteristics of most present-day systems is that they are very good at collecting data and providing that data to the planning and scheduling systems. However, present systems generally have not used the newer technology available for users to analyze operational information directly. In addition, an information model that enables these tools to be used effectively by the end users does not exist. As a result, most computer technology used in the automotive industry today is not compatible with the business drivers that demand the process improvements from a dedicated, empowered workforce. The organizational paradigm must be changed to recognize that the development of new systems is a shared responsibility. The line organization is responsible for defining the goals, making the technology expense and timing tradeoffs and making the impact to the business. The technical community is responsible for providing technical approach alternatives, ensuring the accuracy of the data, and building application systems to support repetitive processes. In this new environment new analysis reports are done in minutes by the line organization and product and operating information is shared throughout the supplier and OEM organizations. Summary In the past, the automotive companies attempted to control the major elements that affected their operations. Many of the factors that play a major role today, however, such as fuel availability, currency fluctuations, and political changes are not controllable. In addition, continuous change will be an inherent part of the global automotive enterprise. As a result the companies with an empowered workforce using highly flexible technology tools will be best positioned to take advantage of the opportunities presented by change. Product information of any form must be easily accessed within each company, and move between the OEM and the supplier as if they were the same company. The technology strategy to accomplish this is to model the information and provide direct easy access to that information. The organizational strategy is for the technical community and the line organizations to work as a team recognizing that the overall goal is operational effectiveness, not individual computer efficiencies.

By ROBIN YALE BERGSTROM, Senior Features Editor ISO 14001 is about more than coolant systems, and stack emissions, and keeping the plant clean and safe. According to Graham Chatburn, Environmental Management Systems manager, Environmental Quality Div., Ford Motor Co. (Dearborn, MI), it's about the global standardization of environmental systems and processes at all Ford facilities world-wide. It's an environmental management tool, so to speak. One that's documentable and third-party certifiable. And it's one that many of Ford's suppliers will undoubtedly have to be paying very careful attention to. Chatburn has spent more than three years establishing Ford's EMS standards program in Europe, first implementing the British standard, BS 7750, at the Halewood facility in the U.K., where the Escort is assembled, and later at the Saarlouis Escort facility in Germany, achieving European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) accreditation. He's now been at World Headquarters for 15 months. His charter: Take EMS global. "This means all of Europe, North America, Asia Pacific, Central and South America," says Chatburn. "Everywhere we have facilities, we'll have ISO 14001." A sizable challenge, as it means something in excess of 150 facilities. And what kind of time frame are the corporations working with? Chatburn thinks Ford will have no fewer than six facilities certified in Germany, Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. by the close of this year, then as many as 50 by the end of 1997. Chatburn hopes to have all facilities certified by the end of 1998. Chatburn suggests that the ISO 14001 certification process is less of an "awesome challenge" than ISO 9000 or QS 9000. "Much of what we've learned in the 9000 series can be applied to 14001. In fact, many of the cross-functional teams and team leaders which have been involved in the 9000 series efforts will be the same ones involved in 14001. Further, there's considerable overlap, especially in documentation, procedures and internal auditing. So, we're not going to be reinventing a registration/certification process. This will be a less taxing effort." Less taxing, but still beneficial. The benefits of 14001 are much like those of the 9000 series--especially when viewed from a global perspective. Taken globally, concentrating on a single set of requirements and goals in the environmental arena, instead of a different set for each functional region, permits Ford to standardize operational procedures in EMS. Commonality of practice produces formalization, which means all sites will have the same goals and take the same steps to achieve 14001 registration and certification. But where's the payoff in 14001 registration? According to Chatburn, the payoff is very similar to that of the 9000 series. "Discipline, documentation, consistency, and continuous improvement," Chatburn says. "Plus, in EMS there is an intangible quality. That of being an environmentally responsible manufacturer--anywhere in the world. Ford, as a company, is assessing and managingeven at an environmental levelits liabilities, which is something those making the product, those buying it, and those who are our neighbors where the product is made can feel a sense of reassurance about." Further, Chatburn says, that like the 9000 series, any such formalized approach to systems management will have a direct impact on operating costs and savings--if only because 14001 demands a common view of the environmental aspects of production processes. What does this mean to Ford's cadre of suppliers around the world? Will they, too, have to achieve third-party registration and certification to 14001? About this Chatburn isn't exactly clear--not that he's being evasive. At this point in time, the picture just isn't clear. "To be sure," he says, "we will encourage them to follow our lead. And we will share with our suppliers our experience." Further complicating the issue is that some of Ford's suppliers, such as those doing plating, have a whole different set of concerns than other suppliers, such as those doing stamping. One thing that is clear, however, is that Ford is not undertaking 14001 under any duress. "No one," Chatburn candidly admits, "has asked us if we're 14001 certified. At least not yet. But as an environmental issue and as a business management and process strategy, it's just the right thing to do. And this is not something we're just thinking about. This is something we're doing, right now."

Then, in the case of Alloy Wheels International Ltd.'s operation in Cardiff, which has an annual production capacity of about 700,000 wheels per year, it is onto a CAD system for the design; they're using CADDS 5 from Computervision. Next, the solid model created in that system undergoes stress analysis with Mechanica software from Parametric Technology and then casting analysis with ProCAST software. The objective, of course, is to make sure that the tooling is designed so that the wheel as designed can be produced. Alloy Wheels sources its tooling for the casting process from a sister company, P.M.P., which is located nearby. The tooling firm makes use of the CAD file generated by the Alloy Wheels engineers. After requisite testing, it is a matter of casting, X-raying the castings (an issue with aluminum wheel production is the possibility of porosity, which is unacceptable), then machining. It is necessary to turn the rim, drill and finish the bolt holes and the center bore, and drill the valve stem hole. Then there is a surface coating process (aluminum does oxidize, so protection is required). Looking for a competitive edge in an extremely competitive market, Alloy Wheels is bringing up a new process for wheel production, Alulite, which is said to produce wheels that are 10 to 15% lighter than those made with conventional processes. Essentially, the wheel is cast pretty much in the ordinary manner. The front surface of the wheel looks normal. But looked at from the side, the casting is squatter. The cast wheel is heated to a temperature on the order of 350 to 400ºC, then moved into a Leico flow forming machine. There are three rollers within the machine that roll out the rim to the requisite size. The machine has a one-minute cycle time. The first customers for Alulite wheels are Jaguar and Rover. It is expected that Fiat and GM will follow, in the `98 model year. Alloy Wheels is developing a production process that is beyond Alulite. It's called "press-split-roll." Instead of casting, the process begins with a flat aluminum blank from which a circular shape is stamped. The features of the wheel are formed on the face of the blank. That's the "press" portion. In order to produce the rim, the blank is split from the edges to the point where the outer diameter of the face begins. The top half of the split material is removed. How the splitting is performed is apparently the trick of the process, as the people at Alloy Wheels wouldn't divulge the method. The wheel-in-becoming is placed in a spinning machine where the rim is formed. It's said that the mechanical properties created are superior with this process. Work on productionizing the process is still underway. Too Much Want to talk about an over-capacity situation that is driving those that want to survive to be lean, mean, innovative and/or deep-pocketed? Check out the alloy wheel suppliers in Europe. There are 15 suppliers with a total capacity of 24 million wheels. More than half of the companies in that group make a million wheels per year or fewer. The largest, Hayes, produces 2.5 million. In the U.S., Hayes produces 7.1 million. These numbers are according to Alloy Wheels International (which has a European capacity of 2.1 million wheels). About that 24-million wheel capacity: the number of aluminum wheels required by European carmakers is 18 million. Which means that there is 25% over-capacity. The real action for aluminum wheels is in the U.S. market, where there is a total capacity of 38 million wheels and a sales total of 33 million. Because Alloy Wheels wanted to be a player in North America, it has recently purchased from Volkswagen a wheel manufacturing facility in Barrie, Ontario, Canada. One of the biggest difficulties for carmakers that he sees in Europe, one which he maintains accounts for the comparative higher prices for cars there as compared within the U.S., is, in a word, "fragmentation." There are, he points out, 34 companies trying to get a piece of the market in the United Kingdom (he anticipates 1996 vehicle sales in the U.K. of over 2 million). Of the 34, there are 20 that have less then 1% of the total. "Being lean," in terms of manufacturing, he says, "is necessary, but it is not enough." He thinks that in order for some European auto companies to prosper, there ought to be some that simply don't survive. That is, he thinks there needs to be higher volume production runs by fewer companies rather than lower volume runs by the existing companies. "In order to get lower prices, the car makers need greater volumes," Rhys says. Speaking of Wheels... Quick: Which of the Big Three uses the most aluminum wheels? No, not the biggest carmaker, GM, but Ford, according to figures from Alloy Wheels International. Ford installs 10.5 million aluminum wheels; GM uses 9.8 million; Chrysler: 4.1 million.

Turning tool insert selection is being simplified in the Carboloy Inc. (Detroit) lineup, a move that reflects not only concerns with inventory minimization (who wants to stock any more different types of tools than they really have to?) but also with changes in the way machining is being performed today (as in much less stock removal than might have been the case five or 10 years ago: think of the near-net shaped parts that are cold formed from high-strength, low-carbon ductile steels that have a whole lot less stock to be removed, or powered metal preforms). The company's Secolor system has gone from 14 different chip groove geometries to three. What's more, there are just three carbide grades. Even with this number the company maintains that this simple grouping can cover an estimated 75% of all turning operations on steels, stainless steels and cast irons. The chip groove designs cover fine, medium and rough applications. They have varying land widths and angles to provide the required edge strength that will break chips over a broad range of feedrates and depths of cut (a breadth which, of course, helps minimize the number of designs required). What about beyond this range? "Even outside those limits," remarked Randy Milliron, a Carboloy product specialist, "you'll usually get either effective chipbreaking or good tool life considerably beyond the nominal range." Factors permitting the good performance: Entrance angle. It's positive. Which means freer cutting and helps reduce the chip temperature. A bump. The chip control geometry includes a bump on the insert nose. This controls the curl of the chip and limits chip contact with the insert to just two points: the entrance angle and the exit angle (which is the bump itself). Since (a) the transfer of heat from the chip to the tool is thereby minimized, and since (b) the cutting forces into the insert are also minimized, tool life is improved. The bump also facilitates the near-net shaped machining. That is, in near-net shaped machining there tends to be a light depth of cut. This produces a thin chip that may bend rather than break. And it needs to be broken. Complicating matters is the fact that near-net shaped machining is usually characterized by higher feedrates and higher cutting speeds, which mean high heat is generated. So there's the thin, hot chip on the insert, which could end up causing cratering. The bump helps curl and break the chip and get it up and away from the insert. There are specially designed inserts for near-net shaped operations. Milliron doesn't think that the Secolor selection eliminates the need for these tools. For example, he cites forged low-carbon steel output shafts for front-wheel-drive cars. These components, machined with high feedrates, require additional chipbreaking capacity. Special tools are likely to be required. A new groove. One of the three is M3. M3 is recommended for medium applications. It can be used at lower depths of cut and lower feeds, yet it has edge strength that permits using it at higher feeds. It is recommended for near-net shaped applications. The starting land close to the nose is tilted a negative 2° for a length of 0.004 in, then it goes up to a positive 5° for 0.008 in. What this means is that when the feed is 0.003 ipr, the chip rides on the negative 2°, so the tool performs like a negative-rake insert. But when the feed is 0.008 ipr, the chip rides on the positive 5° land width and cutting forces are reduced. The insert's positive entrance angle decreases build up in the chip groove and helps minimize the hardening of the work surface which can happen in stainless steel machining operations. Today's machines. Smaller machines are out there in greater numbers. "There are more lathes in use with less than 20 hp than there are with more," says Milliron. He adds, "What today's CNC lathes do have"--if not a lot of horsepower--"is higher spindle speeds, better controls, and better drives that can handle the complex geometries or forms on a part at higher feedrates. Even a moderate horsepower machine can give you high speeds and feeds." Which means for tooling requirements: A chip groove that can accommodate high feeds yet break the chip at a light depth of cut--which, as we've seen, this system is said to provide.GSV Return to Top of Page | Return to AP Technical Resource Center Page [ GardnerWeb Home | Visitors Center | Bookstore ] [ Finishing Resource Center | Metalworking Resource Center ] Serving the Metalworking and Finishing Industries.

But at Honda, they are everywhere--even in R&D. Here's a look at how they work. By GARY S. VASILASH, Editor-In-Chief If you walked through the large room where design engineers were working at CAD terminals running CATIA at Honda R&D North America's Raymond, Ohio, complex a few years ago, you would have seen people who were apparently busily at worktapping on keyboards, dragging mice, turning dials, using styliunless the system had crashed. Or perhaps you'd see them standing at plotters. Sometimes they were getting what they expected to come rolling out. Other times they were frustrated because: (a) nothing came out; (b) only part of what was supposed to be there came out; (c) the output took an extraordinarily long time. There was also a problem related to the model, or file, that could be handled at the time. It was 640K, or about the size a floppy disc can handle. Which meant that complex designs, which take up a lot of disc space, were difficult to organize due to the size limitation. And there were times when, as more people logged onto the system to do their jobs, response times of the mainframe-based network s-l-o-w-e-d. It took seemingly forever to get simple things done. And when you are trying to do extraordinary things, time stands still. However, given all of this, the people seemed to be hard at it, plugging away at the CAD system. But at times, these people were pretty frustrated due to the plotters, the file size limitation, and the slow system response. To say nothing of the crashes. What's more, there was a waste associated with the activity--or inactivity--because what could be accomplished was being inhibited by the system performance. According to Laura Minor, senior design engineer at the facility, who came to Honda from Boeing, where fast CAD systems are certainly a way of life for design engineers, one of the problems at Honda R&D was that although about 80% of the engineers' time was being spent working at CAD terminals, there wasn't a full appreciation among some of those in upper-level management of how frustrating slow response time or any of the other difficulties are because those managers tended to have backgrounds that included experience on drawing boards, not workstations. A fundamental reason, of course, for the general invisibility of the problem was that the people were visibly hard at it. They seemed to be working just fine. But unlike an assembly line, where it is clear how things are moving along in real time, the design activity is such that what is (or isn't) happening is not particularly evident to the observer. It was hidden waste, perhaps the most costly type of all. So instead of simply complaining (i.e., "This system is too slow and inefficient!"), Minor and seven other colleagues did what Honda people tend to do, which is to operate in a pragmatic manner. An NHor "New Honda"circle was established, with the concurrence of management, consisting of eight participants. In addition to Minor, there were two white body design engineers, two interior design engineers, two people from the information systems function, and a person from the technical training area. The NH circle is something used throughout Honda. It is, perhaps, familiar to many people as a "quality circle." However, whereas quality circles in many organizations became disappearing spirals largely due to lack of on-going focus, consistency and application, Honda people have made NH circles part of their on-going routine. At Honda, says Charlie Baker, division director, Automobile Design Engineering, Honda R&D North America, one of the tenants of company founder Soichiro Honda was "Strive constantly for a harmonious flow of work," which lead to the entire company--in manufacturing, engineering and elsewhere--to embrace total quality management (TQM). Central to the TQM approach is the "Deming Circle," which is based on the four steps: Plan, Do, Check, Action. Although the tendency in many manufacturing companies was to organize quality circles almost exclusively on the shop floor, at Honda there are no such limits. "The approach we took," Minor recalls of the CAD NH circle, "was to make a root cause determination and to make sure that we weren't overlooking anything." They came up with "four basic hot spots": the response time, the limited model size, the plotting system, and the system crashes. Then, to make sure that these were indeed the problems, they surveyed all of the engineers. Once they were in agreement, they proceeded to determine just how big the problem really was. For example, they created a program based on what a designer would do in developing a roof (from creating the model all the way through generating the drawing). Then they got volunteers who memorized the program. They then ran a series of tests to see how long it took these designers to do the program. To check the system response, they set it up so that one person came in at 6:30 a.m., a half-hour before the normal starting time, to run it alone on the system. Then they did it with 18 people, then 40 people running the program at the same time. Time and user satisfaction were measured. The efficiency losses based on number of users were calculated and translated into dollars. In 1994, the annual loss from inefficiency was on the order of $700,000. Had no changes not been made, the loss today would be on the order of $3-million per year (given the larger staff presently at work). Other factors, such as the model size used at competitive automakers including Chrysler and Saturn, were measured and used as part of the report on the overall productivity loss. The solution to the problem was determined to be a switch to workstation-based CAD. Although it required an investment in new equipment, the results of the NH circle proved to management that there would be a payback. The bottom line: Quality circles are viable when used consistently. And just as important, they shouldn't be limited to factory-floor problems. The paybacks in engineering can be significant. Zero-Base Plan Saves Big Money The Honda of America Manufacturing engine plant in Anna, Ohio, is, with the ongoing $200-million expansion, the single largest source of Honda auto engines in the world. By 1998, the plant will be producing 3,700 units per day. The 190,000-sq. ft. expansion--which includes all aspects of engine manufacturing: casting, machining, assembly--was done largely to accommodate the new 3.0-L V6 engine that went into production in September for the Acura 3.0 CL coupe. This engine, which is exclusively built at the Anna Engine Plant, features all-aluminum construction; it is the lightest engine in its class (compared with the Lexus ES 300 and Infiniti I30 engines). But the plant is based on flexibility as well as efficiency: L4 engines and V6 engines can be produced on the same lines. One technique that was used by the Honda engineers in determining how to facilitize the plant in terms of the amount of equipment on the floor was to use what is called the "zero-base plan." AEP plant manager Larry Jutte explains that the approach is to determine what is minimally necessary to accomplish the tasks. That is, there are some "wants" and then there are some "musts." The musts get the priority. For example, one piece of equipment developed for engine assembly is a con-rod tightening station that is capable of handling two different-size con rods. Jutte ticks off the benefits of using this single unit rather than two, including reduced floor space and fewer maintenance requirements. The must was to have con rod tightening. Although an ordinary approach would have probably involved two stations, that was determined to be a want. So the single station was developed. Jutte observes, "We could have spent another $100-million in assembly if we hadn't gone the zero-base route."

Here are some things to think about... Robots are meant to provide flexibility, right? Which means the ability to do more than one thing. But if the end effector, or tool on the end of the arm, is fixed, then the robot is really constrained. However, if the robot can change its end effector, then this flexibility becomes a reality. One manufacturer of precision robotic tool changers is ATI Industrial Automation (Garner, NC). Its patented design employs a master plate that is mounted on the robot arm, which mates to a tool plate that is attached to each of the tools that will be used. The master plate features a locking mechanism based on an air-actuated piston. The piston has a 45° taper on its nose so that it can be piloted into the tool plate even if the positioning is slightly off. The unit is designed so that there is mechanical locking effected. Even in case of a power failure, the tool stays put. ATI has developed some recommendations for the selection of robotic tool changers... The first recommendation is to carefully check tool changer specs since manufacturers vary the factor-of-safety. 1.Calculated Method. The strength of robotic tool changers is based on their moment capacity. Use the following to approximate a worst-case scenario. (a)Find the approximate center of gravity (CG) of the heaviest end effector. (b)Calculate the distance (D) from the CG to the bottom of the tool plate. (c)Calculate the weight (W) of the heaviest end effector. (d)Multiply W by D to get an approximate static moment (M), or a moment based on 1g of inertia. (e)Find the quick changer with a static moment capacity with a value equal to or greater than M. Note: Robots may produce moments two to five times higher than their static moment due to potential high acceleration. Check the quick changer's specs for static and dynamic moment capacity. 2.Pneumatic and electrical. Determine the number and size of pneumatic and electrical contacts needed. Larger quick change devices have larger and more pneumatic ports and electrical contacts. 3.Temperature and chemicals. Most quick change units use nitrile O-rings. Nitrile can handle temperature ranges from -20ºF to +150ºF. They can withstand most chemicals. If temperatures are outside of this range or if the chemicals involved are questionable, contact the quick change unit's manufacturer. 4.Precision application. If high repeatability is an issue, be sure to check the repeatability specs. Check if the units have been tested to one million cycles. Note: A tool changer effects a robot's moment capacity, payload, wear, size, and repeatability.

By ROBIN YALE BERGSTROM, Senior Features Editor Founded in 1990 on an old English estate, G Force Precision Engineering Ltd. (Sussex) has built a reputation as a premier specialist in international motorsports--Formula One, IndyCar and Super Touring--for its design, manufacture, test, and track-side engineering support. Two recent projects the company has been involved with are: (1) the 100,000-hp Thrust SSC, which G Force built for Richard Noble for a land-speed record attempt and (2) the design and build of chassis for the 1997 Indy Racing League (IRL) series. The G Force founders are veterans of Formula One and Indy racing. They have surrounded themselves with 40-some experts in flat floor race car concepts, composite structures, aerodynamics, wind tunnel model design and test, pattern-making, metallurgy, fabrication and machining. Shown here is the activity in what once was the stables of an old English estate and is still very much yet a stable--for a different kind of thoroughbred, a very different kind of racing. Like A Pencil Ken Anderson, lead designer, G Force Precision Engineering, Ltd., one of three firms selected to build the new Indy IRL car, needed to develop the chassis in a big hurry. From a clean sheet to the first race of the season this coming January 25th at the Disney World 200. Which led him to have at least three major considerations: time--which is a fleeting finite element, a factor which cannot be negotiated tools--specifically those which help make the best use of what little time there is results--which like time, cannot be negotiated and must be superlative. Tools. This is the answer to all three concerns. What Anderson has selected as a design tool is a straightforward, simple 3D wireframe CAD program from Ashlar, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA), called Vellum. Vellum is not a 3D solids package, nor is it a CAE package. Vellum is a PC-based program that Anderson admits he uses as a 2D "drafting" program--like a pencil. He explains: when he wants to draw a line (the entire IRL car, from components, to wheels, to the body and chassis, has been done in Vellum), he wants to draw it. He does not want to keyboard, like data entry, in points in space what he wants to draw, and then create it with snap keys. He just wants to take the mouse, and draw, and leave the resident 3D capability in the background until--and if--it's needed. The IRL body, for example, is designed entirely in one-inch 2D sections stacked together, allowing the sections, and the spaces between them, to be looked at individually or in total. Then, a simple menu selection renders the body in wireframe, can be downloaded in DXF or IGES for translation for multi-axis machining. Simplicity. Anderson points to an attribute called the "drafting assistant." Think of it like this: You've drawn a horizontal line a few inches across the screen with the mouse. Now you want to place a vertical line perpendicular to the mid-point of the first. As you drag the line tool along the horizontal line, a screen prompt pops up when you've reached midpoint. The "assistant" then creates the vertical line, assuring that if you drag along its length, your second line will be perpendicular to the first. No data points in space. No keystrokes. Just drag the mouse. Like a pencil on a pad.

It's through careful planning, hard work, and constant monitoring. By ROBIN YALE BERGSTROM, Senior Features Editor To hear Mike Alge, engineering manager, Setex Inc. (St. Marys, OH), tell it, his company is no different than any other JIT company. Actually, that's precisely the way he describes it: "no different." Is this humility? Modesty? Possibly. Probably. Certainly, understatement. A Case In Point. Setex manufactures seats for automobiles. Specifically, Honda, which is about an hour away in Marysville, Ohio. And as you might expect, Honda doesn't want its seats delivered willy-nilly, in whatever lot scheme or arrangement the manufacturer might find comfortable. It wants seat-set delivery timed with auto body assembly: if a red Honda is going down the line and ready for seat insertion, a corresponding red seat set had better be there. And Honda's not going to go to its inventory and pulsl the seats, because Honda's not going to hold any inventory in seats (with the exception of those in process conveyance). The challenge, then, is to time Setex's manufacturing , inventory control, and delivery with/to Honda's assembly consumption capacity. Which means that Setex has to know Honda's production schedule. And, just as important, Setex has to know--in real time--if Honda is actually producing to schedule. For example, Honda, for production and scheduling, normally builds in lots of 30 at Marysville. What if, for one reason or another (ultra-high humidity affecting the paint process, for example--not an entirely unlikely prospect in the Ohio Miami Valley in August), they only build 22? What happens to the other 8 seat sets? Are they just set aside? Do they go forward? Are they held? Where? What, specifically, happens to the seat sequencing algorithm? Now, fold in incidental factors. Like transportation issues. For example, hauling by trailer truck the 55 miles between the two plants. Little things like this can become large issues: Setex ships on trailers that are two-tiered (meaning they can handle 60 seat sets, two high). Honda's receiving system (until just this past July 4th plant shut-down) was a single-tier system. Which meant Setex transportation costs (as in number of physical truck trips per day to meet Honda's 800 seat sets/day appetite) could be twice what they needed to be (a trucking company's charges are going to be what they're going to be, regardless whether there's two seat sets aboard or 60). The over-riding concern for people in Alge's position is not to inconvenience the customer. Certainly never to hold up or delay the assembly line--not over seat set deliveries. When a particular car body reaches the assembly line at Honda, which happens every 63 seconds, the appropriate seats had better be there. A JIT Response. One might think that being 55 miles away from your customer would be close enough to fulfill just-in-time delivery. But in the Honda case this is not the case. Alge explains that when Setex receives Honda's broadcast (its actual production as opposed to scheduled production) indicating which car is entering the assembly line, right that minute, real-time (this is done "live" through a PC network, co-designed by Setex and Mathews Conveyor [Danville, KY]), there's about a four-hour "window" for Setex to get the right seat sets to the Honda assembly line. Now, if you calculate the hour or so tied up in tractor trailer delivery time, and another hour of conveyor time once the seats arrive at Honda, plus the possibility of something disrupting the production plan, it was clear to Setex that an interim, insurance step was needed. (An aside: know that Setex has always, since 1988, used an interim warehouse close to Honda. In fact, this was a facility it shared with a competitor, both of whom supplied Honda with seats [which may strike U.S. manufacturers as odd--sharing facilities with one's competitors. But this is Japanese business-as-usual. If Honda wants you to share a facility with your competitor, you share a facility.] In 1992, however, that changed: Setex won the exclusive contract for one of Honda's assembly lines, which required it to set up its own warehousing facilities.) Wherein comes NEX, Nippon Express Company, a warehouse facility that's two-to-three miles from the Marysville plant and that handles a lot of the bulk freight going in and out of the Honda facility. Setex leased space from NEX, and in conjunction with Mathews designed, built, and installed a completely automated (there is one operator required) JIT conveyor and communications system. Run-off for the customer was in June of 1992, just six months from initial concept and design. Since that time, Setex has maintained a flawless record of delivery of seat sets to Honda. The seat sets are now trucked in lots of 60 from Setex to NEX where they are received by a double-deck conveyor. The NEX facility holds up 240 completed seat sets, which is about four hours production at Honda. The sets are automatically conveyed to a transfer car that loads the seats into one of 16 appropriate (as determined by a bar code established by Honda's production schedule and applied at Setex) gravity-flow storage lanes, each with a capacity of 15 seat sets per lane. The sets are then actually "pulled" by a second transfer car, according to the real-time broadcast, into one of two shipping lanes (in reverse order of installation) where they are then conveyed onto a computerized trailer for shipment to Honda's receiving area. All pretty slick, all pretty (and actually) just-in-time. But what happens when there's a glitch--either in Honda's actual production or in the material handling/inventory control system at NEX (which has happened only twice)? If the glitch is big--let's say Honda's only able to build 22 cars in a lot instead of the projected 30. The issue raised above about the eight seat sets in limbo is handled via an SQR (schedule quantity remaining) lane, where the excess sets are off-loaded, to be picked individually as their type again comes up in production schedule. And what if the system "goes down" for some reason? Setex dispatches a crew to NEX to repair the system and to manually operate it so that delivery is not interrupted. The two main transfer cars, for example, can be disengaged from the system and pushed about manually from the storage lanes to the shipping lanes. Losing Sleep, Hair. So, what's the most important thing in operating JIT? According to Alge, never failing the customer, which means designing, building, and installing a system that's predictably reliable. Which means building to your customer's production schedule but being able to switch "on the fly" to meet a change in broadcast. Which, further, means holding no inventory yourself. And none of which means you won't be losing sleep worrying about these issues. You will. This is called being vigilant about your customer's needs.

By GARY S.VASILASH, Editor-In-Chief The place to begin is defining the term: STEP signifies the Standard for the Exchange of Product Model data. Which is a whole lot more easy to remember and easier to say than its "official" name, which is ISO 10303. STEP is an ISO standard. This is not something that has been formulated by a single vendor or a group of vendors. But whether or not STEP will come to a CAD terminal near you has a whole lot to do with vendors. That is, if they don't develop products that are in conformance to STEP, then you may not have the opportunity to use it. A case could be made for the pull of the technology, as in a sufficient number of user, or customer, companies demanding it. Yes, STEP is being developed. Several parts of it are done and can be used today. But, perhaps, the most-important factor is that it is "open." It's non-proprietary. Which is extremely useful. STEP is a neutral format for product definition data. That isn't particularly illuminating. But the illumination can come from taking a look at a real-life example of working with non-neutral product definition data. Jerry Widmer is a program manager, Simultaneous Product & Process Development, Corporate Research & Development, Eaton Corp. (Southfield, MI). He is presently on loan to the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) as an associate director. At Eaton, the computer-aided design (CAD) system that's used is Pro/Engineering (Pro/E) from Parametric Technology. Eaton, as a tier-one supplier, does work for several of the OEMs. Each of the OEMs has its CAD system of choice. There are translators for the CAD systems so that something "written" on one system can be understood by another system. But just as is the case with human languages, those who know the native tongues are able to capture nuances and meaning that can be lost in translation. So Eaton, in addition to Pro/E, has a number of other CAD systems so that it can work with its customers in their native languages. Complicating matters a bit more: it has suppliers that may not have the CAD systems used by Eaton or Eaton's OEM customers. So to facilitate working with its suppliers, Eaton has still more CAD systems. Given that a "seat" for a CAD system--hardware and software--can cost on the order of $40,000 to $80,000 (we're talking the full-blown types as used by the larger organizations, not the shrink-wrapped PC-based packages), there is an investment in gear that Eaton has made that is not insignificant. In addition to this capital investment, there are additional costs incurred, as well: Dr. Thomas A. Phelps, principal member, Technical Staff, Industrial Technology Institute, presently working with AIAG on a STEP development and implementation program, AutoSTEP, notes, "CAD systems are different. No one person can be really good at two unless they are superhuman." Not all of those CAD seats at Eaton have people in them at any given time. People have been trained to use more than one systemit would be impractical to have people trained for one and only one system who might sit there for extended periods surfing the Net or something, waiting to work. This means that there has been an investment in training that is not always being utilized. And when an individual sits down at a workstation she hasn't visited for a while, she'll have a learning curve to climb while becoming more familiar with it (e.g., "Oh, that's what that command does...I'd forgotten.") All of which means that heterogeneous CAD systems add cost, complexity and time to processes and can make quality tougher to realize. And it should be noted that Eaton is not in the least bit unusual in its setup. Plenty of companies have this multiplicity of systems. Because the people at AIAG recognize that this has the effect of adding to the costs of companies without really having benefits to the end customer, they are working to achieve a workable STEP implementation program. Of course, a company should have the right to use whatever CAD system it wants to, assuming, of course, that it can fulfill the requirements of its customer(s). So the fundamental rationale behind the development of STEP is the elimination of the cost, complexity and time related to multiple CAD systems without pulling the plug on any of those systems. (Realize, also, that the standard is being developed for all industries, not just automotive. There are similar concerns, for example, in the aerospace industry.) As Phelps puts it, "The STEP application protocol is a neutral representation of data that anybody can use. Companies can move data between dissimilar systems." Eaton, then, could continue to use Pro/E and, in effect, eliminate the various other systems. This reduces costs. Its people could concentrate on one system and get completely adept at using it. This improves throughput and quality. When it needed to transfer files with a customer, what it would send would go out looking like Pro/E to the last person who looked at it (obviously, the machines don't see the same thing that we do), then show up at the customer's site appearing as a file formatted as whatever CAD system is being used there. Consequently, each firm is able to work with its preferred system. It sounds great. So why isn't it being used right now? There are a number of issues, which is why AIAG created the AutoSTEP program. It is a three-phase program, initiated in 1995 and scheduled for completion in 1998. Phase one included the OEMs and tier-one suppliers (TRW, Eaton, Dana, AlliedSignal, and Delphi Saginaw). The issue here is exchanging solid model information. Phase two adds a few other tier-ones (Delco Electronics and Kearfott) and tier-two suppliers for each of the tier-ones. Also joining phase two are General Dynamics Land Systems and United Defense Limited Partners because the Dept. of Defense is interested in improving its supply chain. Phase two involves solids, drafting, surfaces, and configuration management. Then phase three, which is to start in late 1997 or early 1998, will bring in tier-three suppliers. This will be a test of the automotive umbrella application protocol (AP), AP 214: Automotive Mechanical Design. "This is the dream of the grand, united approach," Phelps says, adding, "The jury is still out on it." In addition to the companies cited, AutoSTEP is also being supported by CAD vendors, STEP tool suppliers, and others. In addition to these technical exchanges, there is a concurrent Supply Chain Integrated Product and Process Development (IPPD) Pilot running, which looks at business issues related to how information is handled through organizations. This includes making as-is assessments of companies, then benchmarking. The output will be best-practice recommendations, to be followed by pilot implementations. The concern is to make certain that people can actually use the technology in a profitable manner once it has been developed. The technical development is something that remains as a concern. The primary issue here is one of whether the data that is being transferred from one system to another is complete. The risk of sending information and not having all of it arrive, and not knowing what's missing, can have project-stopping and career-ending consequences. Each of the Big Three has made public statements of the CAD systems that they plan to use, each of which is different from the other, and there is an evident expectation that their suppliers will be compliant with those systems. Which makes this whole STEP effort seem somewhat curious. But Phelps said that in the near term, once there is high confidence in the protocols, that it is likely that the tier-one suppliers will use it with their suppliers, rather than with the OEMs--at least not in any major way. The long-term objective, of course, is to make STEP the preferred method of exchange for OEMs and suppliers alike. So while STEP may make it into the supply base as a way of working before the turn of the century, the OEMs are unlikely to get aboard until sometime in the next decade. STEP Made Simple Although the programmers and technical people are undoubtedly doing some rather impressive feats of digital dexterity to make the Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data a reality, what you really need to know is that the intent is: To create a global standard (there are efforts underway in Europe, Japan and North America) for product information (not just CAD files, but full information, including things like a bill of materials, germane to the product) that's independent of the CAD system (create the file on one brand of system, work on it with another) and that allows sharing of data throughout the product life cycle (from concept through disposal).

By ROBIN YALE BERGSTROM, Senior Features Editor Pat Meathe, executive vice president & managing director, American Supplier Institute (Allen Park, Michigan), thinks there are at least 10 things that people ought to think about regarding their QS 9000 efforts. 1.The Wake-up Call. A great many companies assume they've got quality because they did some things back in the quality-vogue years of the 1980s. They looked at QFD, concurrent engineering, Taguchi, SPC, design for assembly. They did these things and then promptly forgot them. Quality's not like riding a bicycle. And QS 9000 is waking a lot of people up to this. 2.The Wake-up Call, II. Think QS 9000 is going to make you revisit your quality methods? Take their pulse? Think about this: That pulse is going to be checked and checked again. Every six months. By an outsider. And if you don't have control of the tools, processes, and strategies to validate your quality, then you're probably going to need a doctor--and we don't mean a metaphoric one--because your business will probably go away. 3.It's tools, just tools. If you're intelligent about it, you try to solve problems before they have an effect. So you try to design quality in, but you know you're going to have problems even with this. So you do experiments, which is what Taguchi teaches. And once you get beyond experiments, you look at design for assembly, for manufacturability, for recycling. You look at process tools. But that's what they all are: just tools. Tools don't solve problems. People with the right tools do. 4.Traps. Sure, the OEMs are shrinking their supply base. They realize that as they depend on fewer suppliers, they are in a more tenuous position. That is, if something goes wrong, the OEM doesn't have a vast supply cadre to fall back on. Which explains why they want to make sure that the suppliers that do remain are good. So in order that they not fall into an unexpected booby trap, they want to make sure that their suppliers are sound. Which is why they are so adamant about QS 9000. 5.Your Auditor Won't Be Your Pal. Using a consultant to help guide you through ISO certification is fine. If you don't have the resources in-house to do all the detail work, hire an expertone who's expert in what you do, not something kind of, sort of like what you do. But don't think for a minute that that same consultant can serve as your auditor. That's not how it works. His hands (and yours) are not clean. A third party auditor (you hire this expert, too) will come in and tell you how good your quality systems are (and, possibly, something about how good your consultant was). 6.Nervous at the Tiers. QS 9000 is to set a single standard for all first tier automotive suppliers. But what of the second and third tiers? Need they be QS 9000 certified and registered? Need all suppliers be working off the "same sheet of paper", the same thick book of guidelines? Is that even possible? This is a quandary, a gap, a crack in the system. This is making a lot of people nervous. 7.Next Wave. Will there be a series of sub-QS standards? Like TE 9000 for tooling? Like 14000 for the environment? Like one for production systems, perhaps based around the Toyota Production System? It's a safe bet. And it, too, is making people nervous. 8.Not Charlie's Problem. The quality problem has always been a top management problem. Top management has always looked at these things (like quality), and said, "Here, you take care of this, Charlie." And then they'd move on to something else. QS 9000 has changed all that. QS 9000 is not about a quality manager; it's about the entire organization, from the very top, to the floor, from the product and process, to the suppliers, to customer satisfaction. And top management has to keep its hand in. 9.Here Comes Everyone. Global manufacturing means global sourcing. Which pretty much in the past meant competing on price alone. Now with the buying criteria being twofold--price and quality--global suppliers are seeing the door begin to crack open a bit. They're saying, "Hey, if I get my quality QS 9000 certified and registered, and GM's in Brazil, and I'm in Brazil, I've got a better chance at getting a bigger piece of the action." At whose expense? You might want to check a mirror for the answer. 10.The Verdict. The bottom line is that QS 9000 has changed--is changing and will continue to do so--everything. And the jury, those who'll decide what it all means to everyone in the community, is still a long way from coming in.

By GARY S. VASILASH, Editor-In-Chief "We are a group of engineers," says Michele P. Vidmar, product manager, Measuring Systems, Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Co. (North Kingstown, RI). "When we come at a project, we tend to do so as engineers." Which means, of course, that the outcome of that project is likely to have a highly technical solution base. Whether one is needed or not. "For this project, we"--she means a team consisting of representatives of R&D, software, mechanical engineering, electronics, and even marketing--"came at it as machinists." Starting about four years ago, these people started visiting shops, both large and small. "We wanted to learn about measurement--the opposition to it, and what's needed." In other words, they discovered that some measuring machines seem to be made more to the liking of engineers than machinists. So Vidmar and her colleagues started with the proverbial blank sheet and created what is now being launched as the RefleX, which Brown & Sharpe is describing as an "intelligent coordinate measuring system." It can be used as a measuring machine, a height gage, and even operated as a dial indicator (to emulate a surface plate tool). It can take point-to-point measurements. It can be used to scan for reverse engineering. And all of this can be done in a remarkably straight-forward manner. The yellow and black manual coordinate measuring machine (CMM) is based on the aluminum-construction MicroVal CMM that Brown & Sharpe launched in the late 1980s. If you ever had any doubts about the importance of controls to modern manufacturing methodologies, then the RefleX can put them to rest. What Vidmar and the team determined is that what really makes or breaks a machine in terms of its usability on the shop floor is the user interface. While there will probably be more elements coming out of the RefleX research, including different types of probes and even a whole new machine, the key thing about the product available now is the electronic control unit. Given that this is a manual machine, it is not a controller in the conventional sense of something that moves the elements. But there is a 32-bit RISC processor. A VGA screen. And software that not only has the measuring and processing capabilities needed to meet comparatively demanding measuring requirements, but is simple enough so that its use is straight-forward. Something that someone is actually likely to use.

By GARY S. VASILASH, Editor-In-Chief One of the companies that Prof. Simon cites in his book is Webasto AG, which he describes as "a double hidden champion...the world leader in both sunroofs and auxiliary heating systems for cars." Webasto was established in Germany earlier in this century; its first folding roof--and in the context of this article we'll be concentrating on the roofs, not the heaters--was produced in 1932. Its first OE customer was Mercedes in 1936. The company has grown to have sunroof divisions in Brazil, France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Spain, and the U.S. According to Brett Healy, director of Sales & Marketing, Webasto AG is the world's largest supplier of OE sunroof systems, producing approximately 50% of them, or about 3.5 million units per year. Webasto Sunroofs Inc. (Rochester Hills, MI) is a joint venture between Webasto AG and Magna International. Healy explains that Webasto AG uses the joint venture approach in order to enter markets that it is unfamiliar with. And the U.S. market is actually one that is comparatively different from other parts of the world, particularly Europe. The installation rate of sunroofs in Great Britain is 70%. The rate is 50% in Germany. In the U.S. the penetration is about 10%. This lower rate--growing, but still low--means that processing must be performed with different methodologies in the U.S. Consider, for example, that whereas the average sunroof program for a European vehicle is on the order of 200,000 to 250,000 units per year, the number is more like 25,000 units in the U.S. So due to volume considerations alone, there are unique processing demands for the North American market. Alexander J. Mullejans, manager, Manufacturing Engineering, at Webasto Sunroofs, came to the U.S. from Webasto AG slightly less than three years ago. One of the challenges he and his colleagues faced was to develop a system that would allow the manufacture of sunroofs in a flexible manner so that changeovers could be effected rapidly on a line. In Germany, he points out, the production lines tend to be dedicated because of the high volume of sunroofs produced. That dedicated automation wouldn't work efficiently in the U.S. due to the lower volumes. The ability to make switches and modifications without sacrificing quality was what they were up against. Mullejans explains that the issue was not merely of developing a new and better assembly line for the sunroofs. Rather, it was a combined process, one that involved working with the product engineers so that the sunroofs were not only manufacturable, but shared enough component commonality so that line changeovers could be effected without completely purging all components from the line, thereby helping boost available assembly time. The product and the process were considered at the same time. (This part commonization has the effect of reducing warehousing requirements, which is a part of an overall program at the Webasto site to have efficient space utilization. The company is on track to double the output of its existing sunroof assembly facility between 1994 and 1997 without the addition of bricks and mortar. In addition to part commonization, contributing factors are improved plant layouts, attention to the entire supply chain, and more efficient assembly lines.) The program was initiated in late 1994. A team consisting of representatives of the various involved functions (marketing, engineering, manufacturing, etc.) was organized. Then there was benchmarking of various Webasto European facilities. Mullejans notes that one facility of particular interest was S.A.R.L. Webasto Heuliez, which in 1990 began the installation of a modular bottom-load style sunroof. One of the biggest differences between common practice in the U.S. and elsewhere is the prevailing design of the sunroof. Here the standard is to have a top-load system. To assemble sunroofs for this design, after the roof is prepared*, the sunroof mechanism (the glass and the brackets and the channels, etc.) is loaded from the top in the assembly plant while the motor and controls are installed from the bottom. There are, as a result, two separate mechanisms that are joined only at final assembly. But in the bottom-load design, the entire sunroof mechanism is a single assembly. Among the advantages of this design are the ability to assure the functionality of the entire unit at the point of assembly, but easier installation. After checking out how the French handled their sunroofs, the team went to Germany, where the higher volume production meant more automation was being used to produce assemblies. The French approach to the component was determined to be the right one. And some of the methods used in Germany (in addition to automation, there is a great deal of team-organized work approaches which Mullejans notes were found to be advantageous) were carefully documented. With this information, it was back to Michigan to develop the modular-style bottom-load sunroof designs and the assembly lines, each of which will run from three to five different programs per year, with an average of 35,000 sunroofs per program. The tooling for the lines was ordered in 1995. Two lines went into production in the summer of 1996, with the third planned to come on stream next year. "What we have now," Mullejans says, "is a quality-oriented and cost-effective way to produce sunroofs for the American market."

Do it faster. Assure the accuracy. And don't forget about floorspace requirements." Sound familiar? If so, and parts turning is your bailiwick, here's a sampling of equipment that may make your job a whole lot easier.GSV Doing More. "Multi-tasking" is the name of the game for those who are looking for the means by which they can: assure part accuracy, reduce lead times, cut fixturing costs, and minimize work-in-process (WIP) inventory. The approach is simple. Setup a part on a machine and do lots of work on it. Since there aren't multiple fixturings, there are fewer opportunities for things to slip out of tolerances. Fewer fixtures means reduced costs. And because work is being done by a single machine, there's not as great a need to have WIP. One company that's concentrating on supplying multi-tasking-capable machinery is Mazak Corp. (Florence, KY). An excellent example is its Integrex 50Y, a turn/mill center. Although it has the fundamental configuration of a turning machine (e.g., it has a horizontally oriented 40-hp turning spindle motor that provides up to 2,270 ft-lb of torque and speeds of 3,000 rpm) and can do the expected turning and facing operations, it is equipped with a 15-hp spindle motor for live tools, so it can mill, drill and tap parallel and perpendicular to the spindle centerline. (Off-center line work is facilitated by an optional Y-axis that has ±4.1-in. travel.). The result: it can even machine box-shaped parts. It has a two-position 90° indexing turret that handles fixed and rotating tools--and fairly big ones, as in boring bars up to 3.74 in. in diameter, 17.52-in. in length, and 44-lb mass. Equipped with an optional gantry robot, part conveyor, and automatic chuck jaw changer, this is not only multi-tasking, but lights-out working. Spindle Handling. Move the part rather than the tools on a vertical chucking machine. It allows the elimination of other part-handling devices for machine load/unload when the spindle does the work. That's a principle of the V300 from Index Corp. (Shelton, CT). The 79-hp spindle is inverted, with the chuck and workpiece on the lower end. The cutting tools are below it, stationary. The spindle can handle workpieces up to 5.5 in. in diameter. The travel of the spindle is 590 in. X and 13.38 in. Z. And traverse rates are quick: 1,181 ipm X and 1,574 ipm Z. Tooling can be gang-style or turret-mounted (including live tools with a 10-hp, 6,000-rpm drive). There is also the possibility of incorporating special, dedicated equipment right in the machine, such as laser welding or induction hardening. A Hard Base. When the turning is tough, the machine had best be solid. So the PredatorPlus from Monarch Machine Tool (Sidney, OH), which is equipped with a 4,000 rpm spindle that provides its 20 hp even at 500 rpm with 215 ft-lb of torque, has cast-iron base, headstock, tailstock, carriage, and turret slide to handle the demands of heavy cutting. The chuck is 10 in. It is also equipped with a 7.5-hp AC motor to drive drills, mills, taps, and other tools, thereby providing machining center-like capabilities. Another version of the machine, the Predator Y-40, provides Y-axis movement of the turret ±1.57 in. (or 40 mm) from the centerline of the turret so this secondary cutting is enhanced. Historic & New. The brand name "Acme Gridley" is almost synonymous with the multi-spindle automatic bar and chucking machine. But while it is venerable, National Acme (Cleveland, OH) is also staying up with the times, as in the 1-1/4-in. HP-6 multiple spindle automatic with a spindle carrier system that provides up to 5,000 rpm. It features 25-hp thermally stable, preloaded tapered roller bearing spindle that helps improve machining tolerances, which are said to be 50% closer than those provided by previous-generation Acme Gridleys. Control is CNC (either Allen-Bradley or GE Fanuc). Slides--both two- and single-axis types--travel at 600 ipm and repeat within 0.0001 in. The stock reel accommodates 12-ft bar stock. The fiberglass sound enclosure keeps the sound level to 80 dba. Speed Centers. Getting things done quickly is something that is being emphasized by the people at Hitachi Seiki U.S.A. (Itasca, IL). For example, they maintain that their HiTec Turn 20SIII and 23SIII turning centers--which were designed and are built in Alabama--are the fastest two-axis machines available. Specs include: 0 to 5,000 rpm in less than 2.5 seconds (the top end for the 23SIII is 3,600 rpm); bi-directional turrets that index face to face in 0.1 second; rapids of 984 ipm X and 1,181 ipm Z with 0.1 acc/dec rates. The 20SIII has 15.7-in. of Z travel and an 8-in. chuck. The 23SIII has 24.8 in. Z and a 10-in. chuck. Standard and optional features help boost speed. For example, a patented device calculates offsets and enters them into the controller in less than a minute. The one-touch tailstock goes into position in 10 seconds. A quick-change chuck permits changing three jaws in 1 minute. All in all, it is estimated that setups can be made in 20 minutes rather than the two hours it might otherwise require. Done In One. Precision turning, boring, and contouring in a single chucking--and no secondary operations--in continuous production. That's the word on the 1070 horizontal turning center from Olofsson Corp. (Lansing, MI). Features that make this possible on this two-axis machine are a rigid, thermally stable column; slide repeatability of 0.00002 in.; the ability to handle slide thrust of 933 lb., and a 25-hp spindle motor. The machine has a chuck swing of 18 in.; the X- and Z-travels are 6 and 14 in., respectively. Parts 12 in. in diameter or 12-in. long can be handled. The machine is designed with a compact footprint: 114-in. wide, 90-in. deep and 96-in. high. Control is provided by an Allen-Bradley 9 Series CNC. Cool Operator. A machine that runs for a long time tends to get hot, which can result in thermal distortion. So to permit running for hour after hour, the headstock casting of the powerpath 15 CNC late from Bridgeport Machines (Bridgeport, CT) is designed so that thermal stability is maintained. The machine, which has a 35° slant bed design, is equipped with a 15-hp AC variable speed spindle motor. Running through a two-range programmable speed automatic gear box, it provides torque ranges from 15 to 1,500 rpm and 45 to 4,500 rpm. The lathe has a 2-in. bar capacity and 17.32-in. swing. Travels: 21.26-in. Z and 7.28-in. X. There's a 12-station tool turret. Control is provided by the Bridgeport PC-based DX-32 control. Flexible & Rigid. Four axes of controlled motion--yes, a subspindle is involved here--are offered by the puma 20BMS from Daewoo Machinery Corp. (Carlstadt, NJ). The high-torque main spindle is rated at 20-hp; it provides adjustable speeds up to 6,000 rpm. The subspindle is driven by an automatically synchronized 7.5-hp motor. The machine, which is based on a rigid 45º casting, is equipped with a 12-station turret that can handle live tools at six stations. The swing over the bed is 20 in. and the turning length is 15.6 in. The Z-axis rapid rate is 1,024 ipm.

Here are some of the specifics. By ROBIN YALE BERGSTROM, Senior Features Editor Dr. Hsiao-Wen Lin, head, Research & Development Dept., Measurement Products, Mitutoyo (MTI) Corp. (Aurora, IL), explains that they have developed a new gage tool, the Gage R&R (R&R for "repeatability" and "reproducibility"), to provide a means for gage users to comply with the 1995 AIAG (Automotive Industry Action Group) Measurement System Analysis (MSA) standard for ISO 9000. "We knew compliance was an upper-most concern for our users, and any software gaging tool we were to develop would have to provide that assurance," says Lin. "So Gage R&R is designed specifically around AIAG's MSA standard. When you have hard-and-fast standards to work with, targeted product design comes somewhat more easily." Gage R&R was eight months in development and came out of beta testing early this past summer. Operation: Load gage information into the system software (which can be done by keyboarding or gage-direct via RS232 serial port). Gage R&R works with all manufacturers' hard gages and will build and maintain a complete inventory, including vendor information, and history of all gage studies and reports. The only limiting factor is resident hard drive size. Pop-up screen prompts in the Windows format query the parameters of the study to be verified. For example, you may want to prove out three inspectors, inspecting 10 parts, with two trials (two physical measurements), per part (system capacity permits up to 15 of each variable to be verified simultaneously). Gage R&R will then ask which AIAG study type is to be verified--range method (short form), average and range (long form), analysis of variance (ANOVA). There are five AIAG types to select from. Make the selection, and Gage R&R walks you through the study. Gage problems, if any, are quickly identified via easy-to-read graphic reports (chart formats include Xbar and R charts, whiskers charts, part-by-appraiser charts, scatter plots, and comparison plots) and will reveal inspector problems, part defects, or a gage malfunction. Corrective action (inspector training or replacement, or vendor gage recalibration) is easily identified. If there are no problems, reports, which can be customized to conform to customer needs, are generated to demonstrate gage compliance. System requirements: IBM (or compatible) 486SX/33MHz; 4MB RAM; 100 MB storage; VGA monitor; keyboard; mouse; 16 bit Ethernet card for networking; MS-DOS 5.0; and Microsoft Windows 3.1 or higher.

Apparently, no one really knows why. But when it comes to the why and the how of developing an automotive manufacturing infrastructure for components, the people in Wales know that it is essential, so they are establishing world-class companies to do it. By GARY S. VASILASH, Editor-In-Chief "Devastation" is a word that Dennis Turner, director, Source Wales, Welsh Development Agency (Cardiff), uses to describe the conditions that existed in Wales some 20 years ago. The coal mines and steel mills that had employed thousands of people in the small country (population: 2.89 million) had closed or downsized. For example, in 1980 there were 35 working coal mines. In 1995, just two pits were operating. Although this is not an unusual situation, as many industrialized places on the planet have undergone similar downturns, the Welsh response is extraordinary. A primary focus of the turnaround strategy has been to make Wales a better place for automotive supply firms to setup shop. One methodology that some regions and municipalities have used to attract such firms is to give tax incentives. Which is certainly helpful (although some economists question the usefulness). But what the Welsh Development Agency (WDA) is doing is certainly more compelling from the standpoint of manufacturing than simply reducing the cost of location (although there is that, too). Through its Source Wales initiative, there are extensive programs underway to establish firms as world-class suppliers in Wales. "We are supply-chain oriented because we are a nation of suppliers," Turner says. And there is a thorough understanding that with the consolidation of suppliers on a global scale, the Wales-based operations--assuming that they are interested in survival--need to be among the best found anywhere. Wales? The land of Tom Jones, Richard Burton, Dylan Thomas, the Prince of, and that famous really long place name (Llanfair-pwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllanty-siliogogogoch)? Automotive suppliers? The country doesn't itself have any auto assembly plants. (Prof. Garel Rhys, director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at the Cardiff Business School, University of Wales, comments about the lack of assembly plants: "We've done better in some ways not to have one." He explains that car assembly plants tend to be more fixed as compared with component plants: should there be market changes, the component producer is in a better position to quickly respond.) But there are nearby facilities of companies such as Toyota and Rover (in the England part of the U.K.). Ford has a substantial engine plant in Bridgend, Wales, and a transmission plant in Swansea. A goal of Source Wales is to get business from these firms and others like them (Honda, Nissan, Vauxhall. . .) for the 150 or so automotive suppliers in Wales (indigenous and foreign-owned). Another goal is to attract, and to develop, new suppliers. Automotive is the single biggest manufacturing industry in Wales. And the list of companies that have located facilities in Wales contains extremely familiar names: Calsonic, Lucas, Borg-Warner, Rockwell, ITT Automotive, Trico, TRW, and many more. Consider this: When coal mines and steel mills are shut down, there are lots of pieces of real estate that are blighted. So the people at Source Wales buy up properties in that category, have its Land Reclamation outfit go at them, and not only make them usable, buildable sites, but actually construct buildings on them in some cases. These are then sold, leased or rented to manufacturing companies. This initiative garners about half of the organization's annual budget. The Welsh land reclamation people have become so good at what they do, they have established an international reputation and are now involved in projects for companies and governments around the world. The WDA isn't specifically involved in providing funding for companies to buy equipment (there are people in the Welsh Office, the central bureaucracy for Wales connected to the government in London who are involved in granting; the WDA people work directly with them). But it does work to leverage and improve a company's capabilities. Indeed, one interesting aspect is that Source Wales works with companies on a Japanese-developed methodology called "kyoryoku kai." This has as its end the improvement of all of the suppliers that are working for a particular customer. Source Wales is keenly interested in making sure that if a supplier is recommended to a customer, it is a supplier who can and will meet the customer's requirements without fail. So there is extensive benchmarking performed of companies, based on metrics devised by Motorola. Once companies have information about themselves through self-audits, they can determine where their weaknesses are. Source Wales can then bring together some companies with similar problems and create what are called "Manufacturing Improvement Networks," through which improvements in these weak areas can be realized. But it is the kyoryoku kai, or supplier association program, that really can mean a boon to customers as well as to suppliers. So far, they have organized two groups: one for Toyota consisting of nine Welsh suppliers; one for Rover consisting of 22 companies. What happens is that the companies work together on developing their capabilities with regard to such things as quality, cost, flexibility, productivity, lead time, and new product development. Each company is able to leverage itself through the consolidated efforts of the group; the customer is able to achieve a superior group of suppliers working for it. The customer picks the area of interest, then the vendors work toward developing themselves in that area. Generally there are two or three workshops, two management seminars, and visits to outstanding plants during the course of a year. So far, there have been measured improvements in quality by a factor of 10, with tier-one suppliers having a defect rate of just 5 ppm. Turner claims that there are more suppliers in Wales involved in kyoryoku kai than in any other country in the Western world. Another important consideration is to maintain a good supply base at the first tier, then work to develop companies at the second and third tiers. In a presentation made in London earlier this year, Garel Rhys noted, "There is a sufficient core of major U.K. firms capable of being first-tier suppliers, to the benefit of U.K. firms whose destiny it is to be second tier if they can make the transition to best-practice operations." (Emphasis added). The emphasis at Source Wales is on best practices. Which are certainly valuable to companies whether they're operating in a country where the national food is laverbread (fried seaweed with a slice of bacon on top) or hot dogs. An Outstanding Mission Certainly one of the best mission statements we've ever come across is from TRW Steering Systems Ltd., Resolven, Wales, which provides power and manual steering systems to Ford, Honda, Nissan, Rover, and Volvo: "To be the manufacturer of Steering Systems cited as the role model by our competitors' employees. "Acclaimed by our customers as the supplier which all other suppliers should strive to emulate." When your competitors' people believe that your place is where the action is, then you've really got something. When your customers are using you as the benchmark for other customers, then it is hard to imagine that you'd lose their business. TRW Steering Systems Ltd., which employs approximately 900 people, celebrated its 50th anniversary in June. Chances are that the firm will remain a solid supplier as it is collaborating with the Welsh Development Agency and the Neath Borough Council in the development of an automotive supplier park on a 10-acre site adjacent to the TRW property. This park is expected to be able to support some 300 jobs in the area. Wanted: MORE VOLUME Professor Garel Rhys is the director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research, Cardiff Business School, University of Wales, among other things. For example, he's also an OBE--just like the Beatles. And he assists the Welsh Development Agency. Speaking of the auto scene in western Europe, Rhys remarks, "The pickup truck is used to carry rubble." Which is not a point to offend those millions of Americans who drive pickups as their ordinary mode of transportation. Rather, it is to make a point about the size of the European automarket which, by his reckoning, is actually larger than that in the U.S. In 1991-92, car sales in western Europe measured 13.5 million units. Rhys estimates that there is an upward trend right now that may peak in 1999 at 14.2 million units.

Negative television advertising has again been replaced by, well, advertising. Life goes on. But something occurred to me during the last several months: Which is that no one really addresses the good stuff that's been going on in this country. What's working, and why. Don't get me wrong: I haven't been living in a tunnel, nor am I so naive as not to know that it's true that for the last 18 months or so, everyone so politically motivated has been taking credit for all that's going well with the nation, while denying culpability for all that's not. That's the nature of politics, and Americans don't have a corner on this. What I've been thinking about is why the good stuff--why "America Inc."--is working. What good stuff? Start generally with the state of our economy. Our employment level. Our inflation rate. Our interest rates. Our factory orders for and output of durable goods. Our exports. Our new home starts...In fact, most of the usual economic indicators are on (and have been for some time) the plus side (the stagnancy of real, spendable income for workers notwithstanding). No one along the way has been asking why these things are (don't question what works? Leave well enough alone?), especially when many of our traditional global competitors have been for several years now in the doldrums. Which is another way of saying in highly fragile economic straits--growing unemployment, rising inflation, wild currency fluctuations, falling exports, social and civil unrest. The European Economic Community, for example, can't seem to come together, in any serious communal sense anyway (especially with the German Bundesbank's inflexibility in devaluing the deutsche mark, which leaves France and other countries grumbling aloud about their interrelated currency woes and, consequently, labor/unemployment difficulties). And Japan's long-rumored come-back is not yet imminent ("Don't rule Japan out," is the sage advice. Well, no one's ruling anyone out, but until Japan again fields a strong, competitive team, it's difficult to see them taking the field.). What's been going on (and what we oddly shy away from talking about, perhaps because it makes for pretty uninteresting "news") is that this country has considerable advantages over many of its competitors. And I'm not talking about natural resources (but, of course, there is that, and many observers of Japan say that the "resource thing" has now become a major hurdle they're finding it increasingly difficult to surmount). No, what I'm referring to here is what American business and industry isn't saddled with. Most business owners will tell you they're over-taxed (as will most individuals), but the truth of the matter is that comparatively speaking, the tax burden here is slight compared to many of our European competitors. Further, American business is not saddled with cradle-to-grave employment guarantees (although unions like the UAW strive ardently in their negotiations to secure existing jobs--as well they should). American workers' wages are reasonable compared to those of other highly industrialized countries (one only needs to look at the level of foreign investment--from Germany, from Japan, from Korea--to see this. They're not coming here because of the aesthetics of the countryside to set up manufacturing sites. It's a simple matter: wages, a talented labor pool, and U.S. workers don't take the whole month of August off and head for Spain.) Nor is American business strapped with supporting an enormous social services and welfare system (you think we've got welfare here, visit London, or Zurich, or Amsterdam or Stockholm). The point is that one of the single-most important reasons American Inc. (and our resultant economic good health) continues strong and to hum right along is because it is relatively unbridled by those financial, social and institutional obligations and commitments many of our competitors face--and are increasingly becoming frustrated over how to deal with. Look, I'm not denying we've got our share of problems--social, educational, moral, and ethical. And these draw a lot of ink, headline-wise. What doesn't is that the American "experiment," from a business and industry perspective, is working. Which is the good news. And why it's not on the news.

VASILASH, Editor-In-Chief Most people on the north side of 30 who watched the Extreme Games this past summer on ESPN probably thought, on more than one occasion--during the street luge, sky surfing, skate-boarding, and/or practically any other event"Are these people nuts? Don't they realize they can get hurt? Maybe die?" Of course those exhilarated participants recognized the danger. And yet they took the risks and did awesome and incredible feats because they are willing and able to do so. For some reason, as people age, they tend to become more conservative, reluctant to change, hesitant about taking risks. Perhaps it's self-preservation. Perhaps it is intimations of mortality writ large in fluorescent letters. A consequence is that awesome and incredible feats are the all-too-rare exception, not the rule. Strenuous efforts, if made at all, are undertaken to maintain the status quo. The ethos of the X-Games, "Go big or go home," gives way to "Go slow or don't go." Some people might say that this stay-the-course approach to life is a direct consequence of the wisdom that allegedly comes with age. That is, because we have had the opportunity to try many things through the years, we know what works and what doesn't, and so we do the things that work and avoid the rest. Some other people, those who are on the south side of 30, might skeptically say that it is the physiological fact that as we age our brain gets stiffer and is less capable of dealing with change. Approaches become fossilized. Organizationally--and remember well and always that organizations are nothing but groups of individuals--this maintaining the status quo can actually be more hazardous than zooming down a hill at 60 mph on an elongated skateboard. That's a message that comes out loud and clear in Mastering the Dynamics of Innovation by James M. Utterback, which first appeared in 1994, and has recently been published in paperback form (Harvard Business School Press; 288 pp.; $15.95). Utterback describes with clarity and detail just how companies that seem to be in rock-solid, safe positions can become memories in short order. "This book argues," Utterback writes, "that innovation is a central determinant of longer-run success and failure for manufacturing firms." He goes on to note--and explain with vivid examples--that companies that seem to be unassailable "not only resist innovative threats, but actually resist all effort to understand them, preferring to further entrench their positions in the older products." "Older products" being those that the company has been producing. It seems that what happens is that when faced with a new competitive threat--a discontinuous innovation, something that breaks with the status quo--the tendency in most organizations is to get really good at doing what they've always done. Unfortunately, while that may provide some temporary salvation, in the long run it is a dead end. For example, in describing the U.S. auto industry, he points out that companies started entering in 1894 and the number of active companies that existed for at least five years peaked at 75 in 1923. Within two years, almost one-third of the companies merged with others or disappeared, and the decline continued apace. To be sure, there were factors like the Great Depression that had an effect on businesses, auto companies included. But Utterback points out that in 1923 the all-steel, closed body car was introduced by Dodge. "This new body format," he writes, "dramatically improved the strength and rigidity of the chassis, and at the same time provided an opportunity for manufacturers to move away from hand forming of exterior body panels to the highly capitalized but efficient process of machine stamping." It became the dominant design. Those companies that tried to continue on with other approaches soon found themselves out of business. Those companies that got really good at the processes required to produce steel bodies excelled. Chances are, the vehicle as we know it is probably not going to change much. But at the component level, things will continue to change like mad. Think, if you will, about carburetors, and how quickly fuel injectors came to the fore. Some organizations realize that the future isn't what the past was or the present is. And so they invest in incremental improvements and modest change programs. Utterback thinks this approach is insufficient: "Investments in incremental change may produce measurable benefits in the short term, but they cannot save established firms when their markets are demolished. These firms will not find their long-term vitality renewed, but will follow the lead of the gas lighting industry, the ice harvesters of New England, and others who have failed to make the bold leap across chasms of technological discontinuity." Changes will happen. There seems to be but one alternative: Go big or go home.

(I know, I'll get angry letters, calls, faxes from incensed Quadarians. But let's face it: The vast majority of them work for John Deere, in one fashion or another. A further testament: There are over 50,000 visitors to John Deere from around the world every year, and it's not because of riverboat gambling.) Benchmarking is what I've come to talk about--process benchmarking. How Deere does this. What they benchmark. Who they benchmark. What they look for. What they do with the information. And what can be passed along to those thinking about doing benchmarking, or perhaps doing it now, based on Deere's experience. This is why I'm in East Moline. There's a lot to learn. But what one takes away is less than one might have thought. As in plan, collect, analyze, and implement. Which requires some explanation... By ROBIN YALE BERGSTROM, Senior Features Editor But first this story: There's an interesting anecdote about the original John Deere, making plows in his primitive forge shop/plant, and taking them around to customers, asking them what he could do to make them better. According to the tale, a colleague asked him, "Why bother, John? These folks are going to buy the plows whether you ask their opinion or not?" It's not recorded exactly what John Deere said in reply, but what's fashionably now called "continuous improvement" and "listening to the voice of the customer," apparently continued. And it does yet today. On this you can bet, well, the farm. It's not rocket science. Which is true. Benchmarking is not something mystical. It's not something you need to call in a consultant to get going (although there are plenty of those willing). It's really quite simple. But it does require considerable discipline. Including internal self-discipline. Okay, what does that mean? It means this: If you want to do benchmarking, you must know precisely what it is that you want to know--and you cannot know this without knowing--intimately and in detail--your own processes, those you hope to improve via benchmarking. That sounds pretty commonsensical, right? The thing is, it is. What's problematic is that most companies (1) don't have a good grasp of their processes (manufacturing processes, perhaps notwithstanding, as they by their very nature are and must be disciplined [which is not to say that these processes don't need attention]--how else do products go forward to the market?), and (2) without total understanding of one's processes, there is no hope for improving them. Further, this can only be done by process owners, the ones immersed in the process, the ones who are best in place to communicate the process, the ones best in place to make process changes and improvements. Think of it like this. You want to learn to ride a bike. But instead of mounting the cycle yourself, you hire a consultant. He learns the bike-riding process and hands the bike back, after riding around and around in front of you, and says, "Here's the bike. That's how to ride it. Just do it like I did and you'll be fine." And off he goes. Now, can you ride the bike? Yeah, sure. The same is true of understanding processes. You want to improve one? Get those involved in the process directly involved in the process improvement. Finding the Best. "How do I know who's best?" That's a fair question, when thinking about benchmarking. You want to benchmark against the best there is--best in class, world class, whatever. You probably know who does what better than you in your own backyard--your own industry, segment, division, region. But how do you know who's best beyond that? Some common characteristics of world-class competitors: They know their processes better than their competitors do. They know the industry competitors better than their competitors know them. They know their customers better than their competitors know their customers. They respond more rapidly to customer behavior than do their competitors. They use employees more effectively than their competitors do. And they compete for market share on a customer-by-customer basis. So that's one way to identify who's best. Another is to look at who's winning awards, getting results. The Baldrige, for example. If you look at the 14 companies that have won the Baldrige as a division of a larger company, they've out-performed the Standard & Poor's 500 by 4:1. And if you look at the five whole companies that have won, they've out-performed the S&P's 500 better than by 5:1. There's something in this. It's called getting results--which is who you want to look to as targets for benchmarking partners. Companies bent on establishing themselves in global leadership positions--they're generally the best. Other ways to find out who's best: contact trade associations, other divisions within your organization, your own senior management. Or, you can contact organizations like the International Benchmarking Clearing-house through the American Productivity & Quality Center (Houston, TX). The Clearinghouse is made up of 486 companies and it can assist in organizing and executing benchmark studiesincluding holding your hand (all for a price, of course) through the benchmarking process. Remember this, however: regardless how you search out with whom to benchmark, the process will only work if you keep two things in mind: that of being humble, on the one hand, and that of being wise, on the other. Humble--yes, humble enough to admit that someone (perhaps many someones) is better at what they do than you. And wise--yes, wise enough to watch closely, learn from what you see, so that you can do as well, and ultimately surpass what you see. Part I: Plan. Don't do anything without a plan. Start by identifying what process you want to improve. Most of the time this will come from those doing the process (benchmarking at the process level rarely is initiated on high). Analyze the process as it now stands. And don't simply do a "White Paper" on the process. Because the Paper then becomes the goal, and when the Paper is finished (the research and analysis of the process all neatly documented and bound), it goes on the shelf and stays there, collecting dust, and everyone goes off, thinking, "Gee, I'm glad that's done." When, in fact, nothing has been done (as improved). Nothing has changed. In fact, such an exercise adds no discernible value. Do not do this. When you've identified the process to be benchmarked, select the benchmarking team. As stated above, these team members must be process owners. They must intimately know the process, for when the team goes out (if it does), it must be able to articulate, as quickly and directly and clearly as possible, its own process and what it wants to improve to the benchmarking partner. Think: apples-to-apples. How do I know if I'm comparing comparable processes? Self-analysis and clear articulation--the two keys to getting oranges out of the equation. Note: It's at this point, the planning stage, where some benchmarking teams decide not to benchmark. Doing the analysis, the team may find that it doesn't know enough about its own process to begin to benchmark it. It may be premature. There may be more work needed internally before attempting to improve through outside comparison. Which is okay. Which is what the process is all about: Change. Implementation. Improvement. Another aspect of the planning phase can be internal benchmarking--sending the team to other divisions of the company with similar processes and talking to them about what they do. Two things are learned in this process: One, what the other division is doing around a similar process. Two, it gets the team into the "inquiry mode." Keep in mind that most benchmarking teams are not permanent teams--they're put together of process people for a single purpose, the improvement of a process, and they can use the "practice" of asking process questions of others not familiar with the process they have ownership of. In other words, such internal benchmarking can serve as a dress rehearsal for the actual benchmarking activity. And in this it becomes a confidence-builder for the team. Part II: Collect. After you've gathered intelligence on your own processes, then start developing a survey designed to initially elicit from your partner what you need to do to improve your process and to gauge his willingness to participate. Keep this down to 5-10 initial questions (multiple-page surveys are daunting to those receiving them, are too time consuming [add no value to those responding], and tend to be not well focused. Once this is drawn up, get a list of prospective benchmarking partners and call them. Tell them what you'd like to do. Be specific. Ask if they'd be willing to fill out a survey ("just 5-10 questions, nothing very time-consuming, really"). If the answer is yes, they're hooked. Ask if you can fax the survey, and will they fax it back? This is how strategic linking begins. But wait. What's in it for the other guy? Let's say you've selected 25 top companies to survey. You know that you're going to winnow this to five to eventually benchmark with. What the other participants get is a summary of the 10-question survey filled out by all 25 companies. You don't have to analyze the summary. You only need to identify what your responses were, what their responses were, and let them do with and digest as they see fit the information from the remaining 24 companies (who are never identified--this is strictly verboten ethically). Once this has been done, you can now expand and broaden the number and nature of the questions. At this point, too, you can determine whether site visits are in order, or whether the actual benchmark can be handled in other ways (conference calling, for example. Benchmarking doesn't always mean plane tickets and bad food.). Site visits are typical when the process is a machine-type process, for example, something where actually seeing your partners' process is a real part of the value. Keep this in mind as well: Whether there's an actual visit or some other means employed, both parties expect to receive value in the process. Benchmarking, if nothing else, is a two-way street named Information Way. You have to give and share, honestly, openly, if you expect to receive in return the same honesty and openness--and ultimately process improvement. Part III: Analyze. So you've harvested the data. You've made the site visit(s). You've watched your partners' processes. You've determined the nature of the process "enablers"--those things that give your partners' processes an edge. Now you've come home. Now you begin to analyze what you've got. You write it up. You pass it around. You discuss what you've seen. You dissect it. You make recommendations for change. But in the back of your mind think this: processes across an industry, or across diverse industries, for that matter, may, indeed, be similar, and thus adaptable. Cultures, however, are not. Benchmarking, unlike reengineering, does not start with a "clean sheet." There are cultural issues to consider when doing an analysis for change. There are environmental factors. Is the organization unionized? Are there organizational or structural issues that may serves as barriers to new processes enablers? These issues must all be resolved during the analysis phase. At bottom here is taking what you've learned and finding a way of "fitting" it to the existing culture. And this is a process of adaptation. After all, one doesn't benchmark processes to effect cultural change (which is what reengineering is all about). Which is not to say, however, that the implementation of a sleeker process won't impact the culture. It will. Positively. Part IV: Implement (Improve). Without this, it's all academic. If you research, go out, gather, come back, and then don't act, you've wasted your time--plus the time of your partner. At this point you must take the results of your analysis, your collected recommendations, and implement the process improvement enablers. Then set goals (realistic and stretch), and track progress. But you don't do this in a vacuum. Return to your partner to verify your progress and to absorb any process evolution there. After all, since the initial benchmarking took place, perhaps six months may have passed. And if you're benchmarking a true leader, they've not been standing still, either. Their processes have continued to evolve, and in this sense, the benchmarking never ends. Little Boxes. Little- (or big for that matter) box thinking will kill you--even if you're already doing bench-marking. What do I mean by that? I mean that, sure, it makes sense to benchmark against the best valve manufacturers if you manufacture valves. But does that mean that the best valve manufacturers--because they are the best--have the best processes--in say, order fulfillment? Or in service? Or in accounting? Or in distribution? An example: The airlines wanted to find out how to more quickly "turn" an aircraft (the time between when a plane lands, is emptied of passengers and baggage, is cleaned, refueled, boarded with new passengers, and is again, ready to fly). This generally takes 45 minutes to an hour or so, and to shave five or 10 minutes off this would make an incredible difference--in terms of on-time arrivals and departures and customer satisfaction. To whom did the airlines turn for benchmarking? To Indy car pit crews. The processes, albeit different in scale, have remarkable similarities. The message: If you make valves, and you want to benchmark the order fulfillment process, don't be confined by your own little (or big) box. Look outside, to whomever is best at order fulfillment, even if that should be Frito Lay or PepsiCo. Codes of Conduct. Yes, there is a code of conduct in benchmarking. And if you violate it, the word gets around pretty fast. Actually, it's what you'd expect of good neighbors or partners. For example, you don't talk about competitive issues. You don't try to form monopolies. You don't try to steal one another's employees. Be honest. Up-front. Open. Tell no lie. Bleeding Edge vs. Leading Edge. The difference here is that bench-marking allows you to be part of the latter and not the former. You want to learn from a company that's already done what you now want to do, only you want to take it further and do it better. And this is a fact: If you benchmark against just one company, you can improve by the degree of what you've learned in this single instance. But if you benchmark against three or five companies, you can take those three or five different process enablers, combine the best, tailor them for your culture, and end up with a better process better than any of those you benchmarked against. Which is the way it's supposed to work. Which is why others will want to benchmark with you. Special Thanks. To George S.

Not only are these the now-familiar manipulators, but in many cases the software behind the scenes that are making the machines more usable. Here's a look at some of what's out there... By GARY S. VASILASH, Editor-In-Chief Moves at Motoman Motoman Inc. (West Carrollton, OH) has been making some big moves into the auto industry of late, both at the OEM and supplier levels. Although largely known for its innovative arc welding-based systems, it is looking at some innovative applications of arms. One is with its NYII series of robots, which are big and strong. There are three in the line. The NY170L-II has a payload capacity of 170 kg (374.8 lb) and a reach of 3,026 mm (119.13 in.). The NY300-II has a 300-kg (61.4-lb) capacity and a 2,533-mm (99.72-in.) reach. Finally, there's what Motoman engineers say is the robot with the highest payload capacity in the business, the NY400S-II, which can handle 400 kg (881.8 lb) and has a 2,047-mm (80.59-in.) reach. The repeatability of all of the robots is ±0.5 mm (±0.02 in.). In one installation, a NY300-II is being used in a casting application. As people familiar with the robot industry will remember, casting is one of the original applications for robots. Of course, those were hydraulic robots. The NYII series is fitted with compact, low-maintenance AC servo motors. And whereas those early applications tended to be material handling, the NY300-II is being used in a machining operation: it is picking up six-cylinder manifold castings, which weigh approximately 40 lb., then presenting the aluminum parts to a saw, that removes the gates from the castings. The conventional approaches are to have a dedicated cutoff machine, which minimizes (at best) changeover opportunities, or to have strong operators manhandle the parts. Apparently, by doing the job with the robot, the company in question realized a payback in seven months. The reason that this job can be done with a robot, explains Craig Jennings, Motoman executive vice president, is not just because it can pick up 40-lb. parts cycle after cycle after cycle. "The gears of earlier robots would have been simply destroyed by all of the vibration that would be created during the cutting," he says. So a stiff arm is as important as a strong one. Motoman is paying careful attention to making its robots more functional in operation, with an array of products such as ComArc III, a non-contact through the arc seam tracker that allows accurate arc welding at speeds up to 60 ipm and Labyrinth, which assures alignment of the welding torch and therefore better welds. It is also making it easier to get them going, such as with Visual Pallet, a Windows-based software package for optimizing palletizing operations, and to keep them going, as with RobotPro, a PC-based diagnostic expert maintenance system. One of the more notable systems of late is ROTSYRobot Off-Line Teaching System of Yaskawa (Yaskawa is the parent company of Motoman). Simply stated, it is a Windows-based (Windows `95 or NT) package that can be run on a PC (486 SX or higher) and allows the development of 3D robot cell layouts, program simulation and cycle-time analysis, and off-line programming. Part information can be loaded via DXF; Dynamic Link Library (DLL) permits the modeling of conveyors and the like. So what this all means is that users can simulate a workcell and actually create the necessary program to run the robots--all on a PC screen. "We're offering this for just $10,000," Motoman president and CEO Phil Monnin points out with a certain amount of pride, noting that other simulation packages tend to be workstation-based and much more dollar-intensive. Action at Adept Brian Carlisle is certainly pleased with a new robot that Adept Technology, Inc. (San Jose, CA), the company he heads, has just introduced. It is the AdeptThree-XL direct-drive robot, based on the SCARA design of the AdeptThree robot. Whereas the AdeptThree-MV can make a straight-line move from point A to B and back with a 9-kg payload in 1.08 sec standard, the XL is 17% faster. The MV has a 7-ft diameter work envelope; the XL's is 10% larger. The standard joint 4 inertial load for the MV is 200 lb-in.2; the maximum is 2,500 lb-in.2. Double it for the XL. The XL, like the MV, can handle 55-lb payloads and position them with a repeatability of ±0.002 in."Good enough for some assembly operations," Carlisle comments. Carlisle, chairman, CEO and co-founder of Adept, is convinced that this robot has excellent application opportunities in installations where there are medium-sized components that need to be handled with speed and accuracy, such as in transmission plants. Yet in addition to the obvious enthusiasm that he has while watching the AdeptThree-XL going through its motions, Carlisle is more emphatic about the importance of why people just shouldn't think about robot arms but, rather, take into account the larger system. Carlisle points out that all things considered, if there is a robot and a cell built around it, chances are good that the arm accounts for about 25% of the total price. The ancillary equipment and the systems integration accounts for the rest. The price of the arm pales when the tab for the system is considered. So one of the things that Carlisle and his company are doing is more than creating robots that have become benchmarks in the industry. They are vigorously working on developing the means by which robots can be installed and up and running quickly. "Rapid Deployment Automation" is Adept-speak for this program. But as Carlisle describes it, it is a whole lot more than slick rhetoric: "Historically, it has taken about 18 months from the time a customer makes an initial call to the time that a line is running on the floor. My goal with Rapid is two months. A 10:1 time compression." How are they doing? "Most jobs, on average, take nine to ten months." So the compression is well underway. In Carlisle's scenario, there are basically four layers. First there is the design layer, the creation of what the cell or system will look like. Then once that's done, the information is passed on to the second layer, product knowledge. In Adept's case, the core expertise is in the area of assembly, so it helps provide the reusable tools that can help here for off-line logic development, or programming. Then, there is the third layer, real-time control. Finally, there is the fourth layer, which not only consists of robot arms, but such things as flexible parts feeders and material handling devices, and so on. Last year Adept merged with SILMA, a simulation company, which brings AdeptRapid simulation capability (available on PCs). For a number of years Adept has been working on developing menu-driven application packages for programming (e.g., AIM MotionWare). It has a line of MV controllers ("We've taken something the size of a refrigerator," Carlisle says, "and have brought it down to the size of a breadbox--and smaller."). And in addition to an assortment of robots, it has linear modules and a programmable parts feeder. To be sure, arms are important. But only part of the automation solution. ABB Activities The big news from ABB Flexible Automation (New Berlin, WI): new robots in the IRB 2400 line. There's the IRB 2400L, which has a 70-in. reach and a 11- to 15-lb load capacity. A good application for this unit is arc welding. There's the IRB 2400/10, which has a 59-in. reach, a 22-lb rated load capacity, and unlimited motion in its 6th axis, which means that the tool can quickly travel directly from point to point as required. This is useful for cutting, deburring, and adhesive application. Then there's the IRB 2400/16, which has a 59-in. reach and a 35-lb capacity. Material handling and machine tending are obvious candidates for this robot. Each of these robots has been designed and built with 40% fewer parts than previous models, which helps improve reliability. ABB, too, is emphasizing software tools. It has a suite called RobotWare, which includes four classes: BaseWare (basic operating system), Process-Ware (for specific applications, like welding and painting), DeskWare (for programming and performing training and analysis on a desktop PC), and FactoryWare (for communicating between PCs and factory controllers). And it is developing specific packages. For example, the Welding Systems Div. has launched ARCITEC, a robotic arc welding system that consists of (a) the robot and (b) the control cabinet. The power supply is integrated into the controller, as is the inverter power source. The wire feeder is mounted right on the robot arm. Programming is simplified not only because the operator works with plain-language messages, but also because the power source is pre-programmed for various filler materials and welders. Now at Nachi Nachi Robotic Systems (Novi, MI) personnel are justifiably proud of receiving the Chrysler Gold Pentastar award in June. This is not only because of the 41 companies that received it this year, just 21 are equipment suppliers, but because this is the second year that the company has received it. The key areas for the Gold Penta-star are quality, delivery, price, and technology. Nachi has recently added two robots to its line: the SC35 and the SC50, both of which are six-axis units. The numbers in their names reference their payload capacity in kilograms. Both machines are designed with a compact, narrow configuration, which allows the positioning of more robots within a given area. All hoses, air lines and coolant lines are internally routed, thereby helping provide a clean design. The SC35 provides a position repeatability of ±0.2 mm. Its application possibilities include arc welding, sealing, cutting, assembly, material handling, and palletizing. The SC50 has a position repeatability of ±0.3 mm and can be used for the same tasks. Factoring in FANUC Smaller. That's the word for the LR Mate 100i, a tabletop robot from FANUC Robotics North America (Auburn Hills, MI). The footprint of the robot base measures just 9.8 in. × 7.5 in. It weighs 70.5 lb. It provides a 11-lb. payload capacity. It is quick: axis speeds up to 270o per second. It is said to be useful for machine load/unload applications, welding, assembly, and material handling tasks. Faster. That's the term for the M-6i, a six-axis robot that FANUC people maintains offers "the highest motion speeds in its class." How fast? It's like this. Axis 1 has a 330° range; it can move at 120°/sec. Axis 2 has a 210° range and a 120°/sec speed. More range for axis 3, 299°, but the same 120°/sec. Axis 4 has a 380° range and a speed of 360°/sec. Axis five: 280° range and 360°/sec speed. Axis 6 really moves: a 640° range and a speed of 450°/sec. The work envelope includes a 3.9-in. reach and a 37-in. horizontal stroke. The maximum load: 13.2 lb. Bigger. Certainly descriptive of the M-710i. It has a 99-lb payload. Its double-jointed arm can move out 67 in., a horizontal stroke that FANUC people say is the largest in its class. This double-jointed configuration permits the robot to reach behind itself; that, combined with the possibility of mounting it on the floor, inverted, on the wall, at an angle, or on a shelf opens up all sorts of processing possibilities. The machine is comparatively quick, with the slowest axis, 2, moving at 120°/sec and the fastest, 6, rotating at 340°/sec. Last year Adept merged with SILMA, a simulation company, which brings AdeptRapid simulation capability (now available on PCs). For a number of years Adept has been working on developing menu-driven application packages for programming (e.g., AIM MotionWare).

And in addition to an assortment of robots, it has linear modules and a programmable parts feeder ("In an assembly system, about 30% of the cost is often in custom-engineered bowl feeders. Our unit permits fast changeover. We have one customer that is changing its line every two hours," Carlisle says.). To be sure, arms are important. But only part of the automation solution.

Both robots are fitted with the AR Controller, which employs a 32-bit microprocessor and fully digital servo drives. This controller can simultaneously control up to 12 axes and permits making on-line program changes during production. ABB Activities The big news from ABB Flexible Automation (New Berlin, WI): new robots in the IRB 2400 line. There's the IRB 2400L, which has a 70-in. reach and a 11- to 15-lb load capacity. A good application for this unit is arc welding. There's the IRB 2400/10, which has a 59-in. reach, a 22-lb rated load capacity, and unlimited motion in its 6th axis, which means that the tool can quickly travel directly from point to point as required. This is useful for cutting, deburring, and adhesive application. Then there's the IRB 2400/16, which has a 59-in. reach and a 35-lb capacity. Material handling and machine tending are obvious candidates for this robot. Each of these robots has been designed and built with 40% fewer parts than previous models, which helps improve reliability. ABB, too, is emphasizing software tools. It has a suite called RobotWare, which includes four classes: BaseWare (basic operating system), ProcessWare (for specific applications, like welding and painting), DeskWare (for programming and performing training and analysis on a desktop PC), and FactoryWare (for communicating between PCs and factory controllers). And it is developing specific packages. For example, the Welding Systems Div. has launched ARCITEC, a robotic arc welding system that consists of (a) the robot and (b) the control cabinet. The power supply is integrated into the controller, as is the inverter power source. The wire feeder is mounted right on the robot arm. Programming is simplified not only because the operator works with plain-language messages, but also because the power source is pre-programmed for various filler materials and welders.

Here's a brief look. By GARY S. VASILASH, Editor-In-Chief Matra Datavision, Inc. (Andover, MA), according to company figures, is the 8th-largest mechanical CAD/CAM/CAE software vendor in the world. Its CAM software is said to be #1. European (Renault, with over 1,000 seats, is its biggest customer) and Asian (Toyota is a user) companies seem to like it, if revenue figures can be used as basis of assessment. Yet in the U.S., it is a comparatively small player. So Matra Datavision is bringing to market what it--and several consultants--consider to be extremely powerful stuff. In announcing Euclid Quantum, a suite of CAD/CAM/CAE/PDM products, chairman & CEO Michel Neuve Eglise claims, "We are three years ahead of the competition in terms of technology." They have also invested, he says, in excess of $100-million in developing Euclid Quantum and CAS.CADE, the latter being the underlying framework that permits fast and efficient software program development. "It's not just the money," remarks Bruce Boes, the company's vice president of Operations. "It's also the time--you can't do this overnight." It's taken them five years. They started anew; they didn't modify something that exists. Bruce Jenkens, vice president of Daratech, Inc. (Cambridge, MA), a firm that tracks what goes on in the CAD/CAM/CAE technical space, says that Euclid Quantum is (1) founded on next-generation core technologies; (2) sets new standards in openness, extensibility, programmability, and enterprise scaleability; and (3) is architected for "orders of magnitude improvement" in users' operations. The product is referred to as representing "breakthrough technology and vision." Matra Datavision is being aggressive on pricing. In addition to a limited-time introductory offer, Matra Datavision, Boes says, has established a pricing policy wherein Euclid Quantum packages will be offered at 80% the price of the "closest comparative package." One of the most-important technical/business factors of Euclid Quantum is that it is based on a native STEP format, which means data translations from proprietary formats are not an issue. (There are translation packages available for moving data from packages including Catia and CADDS.) Openness is further underlined by the fact that it runs on UNIX, Windows NT and Windows 95. An interesting characteristic of Euclid Quantum is that it includes a "Web-enabled" product data management (PDM) system, Euclid Design Manager. Yes, this means that there is a Netscape browser built right in. The beauty of this is that files, objects, geometry, text, video, and audio can be exchanged between customers and suppliers via the World Wide Web. An objective is to create what Boes calls "collaborative concurrent engineering," which means that not only are all parties working with the current information (one of the benefits of a PDM package), but they are able to collaborate through improved information exchange. The foundation package is Euclid Designer. Surfaces, solids and assemblies are in a single CAD model. There is a feature-based modeling approach which means that parametric or variational solvers are automatically selected. An associative bi-directional drawing capability means 2D changes are reflected in the 3D model and vice versa. It is based on an object-oriented database, which means this is more than geometry; mechanical information is also included. The next step is to Euclid Analyst, which permits analysis on the CAD model geometry. This helps speed the process since the CAD model created, not a recreation of the model, is what's worked with for analysis. Within the Designer package there's an electronic notebook that allows designers to include information about such things as constraints and other features--design intent info. Similarly, Analyst has an Analysis Reporter for analysis intent and information about previous runs. Then there's Euclid Machinist. "Our models are 100% machinable," Boes says. "We just don't create cool images." It is a feature-based package. Geometry and information about the operation are used as a basis for programming the machining operation. Prompts can help reduce programming time. An Instant Cycle Update feature speeds the simulation of various machining approaches.

Now it is being launched to everyone else. Here's a look. By GARY S.VASILASH, Editor-In-Chief Because a casting has comparatively immense amounts of time and money invested in it by the time it is ready for boring, that operation calls for considerable care. That means setup is crucial. That, in turn, ordinarily means that comparatively long setup times are involved to get the tool positioned just right. To be sure, high accuracies can be obtained through the use of a variety of available boring systems. But a question is the amount of time that it takes to get things just right. What if figuratively "dialing in" a boring head to dead-on accuracy was also literally doing so? (And by "dead-on" we mean precision up to two microns [.000079 in].) Evidently, this is precisely the case with the Romicron fine boring system. Kennametal Inc. (Latrobe, PA), has the worldwide exclusive rights to this system, developed and patented by Giordano Romi, president of Industrias Romi S.A., a major South American machine tool and plastics machinery builder. Necessity was the mother of invention. The issue, according to Doug Moore, Kennametal Romicron product manager, is one of time. "People are always making adjustments to and fiddling with boring setups to get the right size," he says. What makes the Romicron system--which consists of 12 heads covering bores from 0.40 to 12.8 in.--unique (so unique that apparently, when Mr. Romi first went to the U.S. Patent Office, the reviewer there didn't think that it would work, so Mr. Romi came back with a 100:1 model and showed him; the patent was granted) is that in order to make an adjustment of 0.5 micron on a radius, it is a matter of turning a dial: Click. There it is. A 0.5 micron adjustment. The operator can hear the click. Feel the click. And, of course, look at the dial and see that the necessary adjustment has been made. This adjustment can be made in a matter of a few seconds. "At the beginning of our association with the product," Moore admits, "I was dazzled at the 0.5 micron on the radius and 1 micron on the diameter. I thought that maybe this would mean the elimination of some grinding operations. But then I realized that it wasn't the most special aspect. Lots of boring systems will get you that accuracy. The big deal is that you can get it in seconds." They've run some numbers on a spread sheet to figure out what this can mean to high volume manufacturers of components like transmissions (bore diameters for cases), pistons (pin diameters) and engine blocks (cylinder bores). Assuming a three-shift, seven-day, 50-week-a-year operation with a couple of adjustments an hour, and a burden rate of $50 to $60 per hour, they calculate that payback for the Romicron can be achieved in just under two months. The key to this is the time factor. Assuming that this is running on a machining center and so it is a matter of stopping the machine, opening the doors, making the click(s), and resuming, a sequence that takes about 30 seconds, this is the kind of return that Moore says can be realized. He says that the same thing with a conventional boring system--including Kennametal's own--would take two minutes. The price for the Romicron system? "It isn't the highest, but it is higher than what people have paid for general boring in the past," Moore says. Units start at about $1,200 and go to $4,000. Two points: (1) part print tolerances aren't what they were in the past and (2) the payback figures still hold. One manufacturer discovered that there was an even bigger payback: whereas it had anticipated requiring a boring mill for a piston operation, with the Romicron it could get the required results right on the machining center.

It is not a highway golf cart. It is a production automobile. Is the EV1 history in the making? Absolutely. This will change the way cars are built. By GARY S. VASILASH, Editor-In-Chief Whether the EV1 is in itself a--marketing success is any-one's guess--and undoubtedly the subject of plenty of computer and meeting time throughout the entire GM organization, all the way to the top (it is the cover shot of the 1995 GM annual report; it is the first vehicle in the corporation's history--and realize it was established in 1908--to carry a "GM" designation). Robert C. Purcell, Jr., executive director, GM Advanced Technology Vehicles, GM North American Operations, admits that the $350-million investment in development made since 1990 "will not be recovered in the sale of the vehicle." He states, unequivocally, however, "This car is the first. It is not the last." So there will be a generation of products from GM that will be, in effect, the offspring of the just-born EV1: different types of battery-power units; combination fuel cell-electrics, and so on. The EV1 is not an experimental vehicle. It is a production car. Maureen E. Midgley, plant manager for EV1 Manufacturing at the Lansing Craft Centre in Lansing, Michigan, won't say how long it takes to build an EV1. There are presently 54 hourly craftspeople at work building the cars (yes, "craftsman" is the job designation; further classification is based on whether they are in materials, production, or quality). They are working one shift. Should there be a strong demand for the car, a second one can be added. And she admits that the production layout is such that capacity can be added in short order. Bob Purcell says that in terms of direct assembly hours, the EV1 "sets a new standard." What is the EV1? It is a car. Two doors. Two seats. Four wheels. It is fast: 0 to 60 mph in under 9 seconds. Like a Saturn or a Corvette, it has plastic body panels. In its case, the front and rear fascias, front fenders and rear quarters are reinforced reaction injection molded (RIM) polyurethane; the doors, roof, hood, and decklid are fiberglass-reinforced low-density sheet molding compound (SMC). There are other panels on the EV1 that are unlike those found on other production vehicles: structural reaction-injection-molded (SRIM) polyurethane bellypans. Put these components together, along with specially-developed Michelin tires and the glass, and the result is an aerodynamically slippery shape: 0.19 drag coefficient, which makes the EV1 the most aerodynamic production vehicle being made. When you get to the frame, things become somewhat different: it is an all-aluminum space frame that is more like something from the aerospace industry than the auto industry. The assembled frame (165 parts are put together with rivets, welds and adhesives) weighs 290 lbs--just 10% of the curb weight, which is 2,970 lbs. The real difference, of course, is that there is no internal combustion engine. The drive unit, which contains a two-stage gear reduction and differential, weighs 150 lbs., which is less than a third of the weight of a four-cylinder engine and transaxle, and provides 137 hp. The real weight of the vehicle is represented by the T-shaped pack of 26 Delco VRLA (valve-regulated, lead-acid) batteries that provide the energy to move the machine. Each battery weighs 41.4 lbs. Combine the batteries and all of the necessary mounting and wiring components, and the total package weighs 1,175 lbs. So once the whole thing is ready to go, it will go from 70 to 90 miles (depending on driving conditions) on a charge. Recharging is done through an inductive system developed and manufactured by Delco Electronics. The Magne-Charge system is the first-ever electric vehicle charger to be UL listed by Underwriters Laboratories; SAE adopted J1773, the Recommended Practice for EV Inductive Charge Coupling, in January 1995, which this system conforms to. There are two types of chargers. One is a 6.6-kW, 220-volt module (for installations in garages and in public places) that provides a full charge in about three hours. There is a 1.2-kW, 120-volt unit that's a standard feature in the truck of the EV1; it can be plugged into an ordinary household outlet and will recharge the vehicle in 12 to 14 hours. But what about the claim that the EV1, whether or not it is a success, will change the way cars are built? Consider: This was designed and engineered to be a super-efficient vehicle. Bob Purcell thinks that a good part of the return-on-investment that GM will realize from the EV1 program will be found through what the engineers have done to achieve the efficiency in terms of componentry: "The components represent an opportunity to improve the efficiency of any class of vehicle that GM makes--internal combustion engine vehicles, too." For example, consider the instrument panel (IP). Because the objective is to have a vehicle with longevity, instead of using a vinyl over a foam, which is a common practice, the EV1's IP and center console are two fiberglass reinforced urethane moldings covered with a sprayed urethane skin. There are several ramifications. One is that the longevity factor is addressed: the engineers reckon that the IP will handle sun loads for 10 years without problem (and given that the initial markets are in Arizona and California, that is not a trivial consideration). The IP has a mass that's 50% less than that of comparable vehicles. The moldings are self-supporting, which means that extra trim plates and attachments aren't necessary, which means fewer parts are required for assembly, and squeaks and rattles are consequently minimized. The steering wheel frame is a single magnesium diecasting rather than a steel fabrication, which is the norm. "This is a smart way to use premium materials," Michael W. Liedtke, chief engineer, Vehicle Systems, GM Advanced Technology Vehicles, points out: the part consolidation is an advantage, as is the fact that magnesium has a mass one third lighter than steel. Magnesium is also used for the bucket seat base; extruded aluminum tubing is used for the upper seat frame. Add the foam and the one-piece seat cover (which means no seams) and a bucket seat weighs 23 lbs., or about 20% less than a conventional seat. The 14 × 4.5-in. aluminum wheels are made for GM with a squeeze casting process, which eliminates porosity. At 8.5 lbs. each, these wheels are said to be the lightest used on any product vehicle. Squeeze casting is also used for the steering knuckles. Working with aluminum casting became both an art and science: EV1 development resulted in 23 patents, three of which are related to aluminum casting. All of these things--and more--have the applicability to other types of vehicles. Making It Happen The EV1 isn't assembled like most production vehicles. Consider the fact that the vehicle's structure is a weld-bonded aluminum space frame. Which means there is a combination of structural adhesives (nearly 500 ft of epoxy per vehicle) and welds (approximately 2,000) employed to put the various components together. (There are also 150 structural rivets employed in areas where there is restricted access or the attachment of dissimilar materials: like the cast shock tower to the sheet space frame component.) Weight was a critical consideration. In fact, Liedtke says they were "fanatical" about weight during the development to the extent that all components were measured in grams. Since the goal was to make things as light as possible, not only was aluminum selected as the material, but light component forms were developed. For example, in addition to stamped aluminum components (e.g., a single-piece door ring), which are fairly common in aluminum based vehicles (e.g., the Acura NSX), extrusions and foldings are also employed on the EV1. For example, the windshield header is an extrusion that's run through an NC bender in order to obtain the required curvature. Liedtke points out that had this component been stamped, there would have needed to be several more expensive dies involved in fabrication, as well as two pieces to process rather than a single extrusion. An example of a folded, or press brake-processed part, is the battery tunnel that runs down the center of the vehicle. Maureen Midgley points out that the extrusions and foldings are less expensive to produce than stampings, particularly as regards the cost of tooling. But welding these aluminum components can be somewhat more tricky, especially as there is the additional factor of the epoxy sandwiched between two pieces of aluminum. The welding is performed with manual spot guns. To help assure weld quality, a touch-sensing system was developed to assure that the electrodes are properly seated before welding commences. This system, in addition to providing better process control, also has an operator safety-related benefit by helping assure the appropriate fitup. Midgley says that GM engineers are working with engineers from Alcan Rolled Products Co., the supplier of the aluminum for the frame, to develop an artificial intelligence system for weld process characterization. The size of the weld guns is bigger than that which are the norm. One reason is because whereas spot welding guns on conventional assembly lines do a few welds, the guns being used at EV1 Manufacturing within the Lansing Craft Centre are being manually employed by people who are doing a whole lot of welds per operation. Although the vehicle is ultrahigh tech, the manufacturing operation in many ways blends the latest with the most-traditional of manufacturing processes. "Whereas most assembly plants have gone automated, we're really a manual operation," Midgley says. The setup is such that there are seven stations in the body shop and eight stations in general assembly. As a result, individual workers perform numerous tasks while a vehicle is in station. Midgley estimates that compared to what a worker does in a conventional assembly plant, the craftspeople in Lansing have 50 times more job content. She knows a little something about this first-hand, as she spends a day a month working in the plant. Whereas a car is usually in station at a typical assembly plant for 60 seconds or less, cycle time at EV1 Manufacturing is, in some cases, 45 minutes. These well-trained workers are represented by UAW Local 1618. One of the consequences of the fewer stations is a different build approach, which can have benefits on the vehicles' quality. For example, it is common for certain key fasteners in an auto assembly to be torqued to a computer-controlled level. That's the case for all of the EV1 fasteners. Midgley explains that since there are a multitude of jobs performed at each of the stations, far more than is the norm in an assembly plant, the cost of instrumented equipment is not prohibitive. Since an operator will be making some torque-controlled attachments and therefore has the instrumented torque gun at hand, using it for all applications becomes a sensible and effective use of the equipment. In order to assure that the operator doesn't have to be concerned with setting the appropriate torque for a given fastener, it is done automatically. Once the necessary tool is removed from the tooling fixture, the system recognizes which tool has been selected, then sets the appropriate torque curve for the fastener type. The 100,000-sq. ft. assembly plant was actually a mothballed facility. In June 1994, Bob Thompson was named director of manufacturing for EV1 and was given a target nine months later for prototypes off the line. There was no line. No plant. No workers. What had been the Buick Reatta Craft Centre became the EV1 Manufacturing operation. Thompson and his colleagues hit the target. Midgley says that during the development period, when equipment was being acquired, one initiative was taken by "young, energetic manufacturing engineers." They went searching through various "basements" of GM plants to find unused but usable tools that could be acquired for the EV1. "We've got a Cadillac side frame tool, and a large trunnion base from another plant and..." Midgley comments. Which is not to say that there isn't contemporary technology being used, like the weld guns and the torque guns. Like other auto assembly plants, there is robotic technology. Unlike other auto assembly plants there is only one robot. This robot, developed by GM North American Operations Engineering, is used for glass sealant application. In most robotic sealant application arrangements, the robot manipulates the sealant application equipment through space while the glass is stationary. In the EV1 setup, the robot manipulates the glass through space while the sealant application equipment is stationary. According to Midgley, who is a chemical engineer and who spent 15 years in painting operations (Saturn, Reatta, GM Wentzville), this arrangement provides the ability to use a better sealing material because there isn't a need to push the sealant through tubing as far as is necessary when the sealant application nozzle is on a robot arm, several feet away from the container. One other interesting fact about the plant. Station five in general assembly is where the glass is installed. There are also fluid fill and power up. For the remaining stations, there is no need for any kind of conveyance: no moveable line; no AGVs. The car is started up and is driven to the following stations. There are no exhaust or flammable fuels to worry about. Where Can You Buy an EV1? You can't buy one. They will be available only on three-year leases. Saturn retail facilities in the greater Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, and Tucson metro areas will be handling the vehicles. Why in those places? The EV1 works best in places that are flat and warm. (The vehicle will be valued in the mid-$30s.) But realize that the GM Advanced Technology Vehicles operations are in Troy, Michigan, where it is flat and cold. Within 10 years, GM engineers anticipate, they'll have cold-temperature electric vehicles.

VASILASH, Editor-In-Chief When the wave of layoffs occurred in the early `80s, those washed away were, for the most part, among the blue-collar ranks. But just as the ocean doesn't produce a single tidal wave and call it good, there has been a series of layoffs. The word "downsizing" has entered general parlance in order to make talking about it less painful. Those who have been caught in the undertow don't find it more comfortable, regardless what it is called. White-collar workers foundand continue to findthemselves out of jobs, too. A variety of initiatives aimed at improving productivity and profitability--lean practices, reengineering, TQM, etc.--depending on who is in charge (i.e., someone interested in long-term growth or someone interested in short-term improvement to the bottom line)has led to further employment wipe-outs. With the acquisition of supplier companies by other supplier companies, there are additional job losses as what is called "rationalization" takes place: managers figure out what's redundant in the combined organization, and then there go the people. Although none of this is pleasant to think about it, you should know that things aren't going to get better. If you are a manager--at any level of an organization--then you really need to learn how to surf, because the waves are going to get more aggressive. One of the most astute, telling, and dead-on accurate assessments I've come across vis-à-vis what management means today and what it is likely to mean in the future is found in Stewardship by Peter Block (Berrett-Koehler; 1993). He writes: "No one should be able to make a living simply planning, watching, controlling, or evaluating the actions of others." In other words, the age of the command-and-control voyeur is gone. Do something tangible, add value, or you'll undoubtedly have to find something else to occupy your working hours. Or consider this from James Champy's Reengineering Management: The Mandate for New Leadership (HarperBusiness; 1995): "[W]hat must be abandoned by the new management of our corporate ships--that is, both officers and crew--is a whole ideology, a whole way of thinking about power. Power no longer belongs in boxes, in titles, in ranks. In the new heavy weather, those are nothing more than heady abstractions, eloquent vacancies, and they count for nothing. What counts--for power, authority, responsibility--is what you can do, you yourself, you with your own skills and personal qualities." This whole theme is the basis of a just-published book, Managing Without Management: A Post-Management Manifesto for Business Simplicity by Richard Koch and Ian Godden (Nicholas Brealey Publishing; 248 pp.; $25.00). These guys--both of whom are British management consultants (yes, they realize that they are biting the hands that feed)--don't pull any punches: "[E]very large corporation contains thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of people whose main role is to manage a corporation's internal processes, and whose value to the corporation's customer's and owners is negligible or even negative. It is this sort of management, including their support staff, that is at the root of the large corporation's problems; and systematically rooting out such management and the mentality behind it, without sacrificing control and old-fashioned leadership, is the key to the rebirth of the large corporation." They take the small, customer-focused firm as the model of what can be, what should be. These organizations have people who are hands-on, adding value to customers. In contrast, they maintain that senior managers in large firms spend 80% of their time involved in "reactive problem solving" and the minutia of business: 30% in meeting about problems; 15 to 20% dealing with the politics of those meetings; and 30% doing things like writing memos about procedures and appointments. What they should be doing, they note, is meeting with customers and suppliers, visiting their operations, coaching and team building, and performing strategic decision making. Koch and Godden argue that information technology now available (think of enterprise resource planning [ERP] and manufacturing execution systems [MES]) make it possible for large organizations to operate with fewer people who are involved in planning, organization and administering. Koch and Godden are talking "fewer" as in "a 50 percent reduction in the number of managerial, clerical and other overhead functions over 10 years." And their clock is running now. Whether this will happen to this extent remains to be seen. But what is abundantly clear right now is that if you're not tangibly adding value to what your customers receive, and if you're not obsessed with providing your customers with a superb product, then you're probably doing something that doesn't need to be done. Which, as lean thinkers everywhere know, is mudawaste. And no firm--big or small--can afford that.

However, in a more contemporary context, it sounds more like: "There's nothing more constant than change." And just as this is true of life, it's just as true of making things: why are there so many different car makers all making so many different cars? Because the buying public's taste, its estimate or notion of what's grand, sublime, or just cool, is as slippery as mercury (tail fins once--you bet; smooth jelly bean shapes now--who'd have guessed?). And needs change. And what's allowable changes. Rules, those of making things and those of using them, change. Everything, including (and especially) opinion, changes. But perhaps the type of change discussed most often in the pages of this magazine and others (outside of design issues), is organizational change. Some call it reengineering (and to many just hearing the phrase strikes fear into the heart: "The Reengineering Team is coming to spend some time with our department. It's been nice knowing you.") Others call it internal benchmarking. Others, corporate revisioning or reinvention. Whatever it's called, it has to do with changing corporate structure and behavior. In order to face change. To managing change. To try to anticipate change (especially that of ones' competitors). And to do all of this while avoiding risk. Which is a notion that most would agree doesn't make sense (you've got to risk if you're truly going to change, because the nature of change characteristically and inherently involves the unknown as result: the new thing is not the old thing. If it is, change hasn't happened. What might have happened, at best, is adaptation). But few--if you really look deep down inside yourself, inside your organization--willingly step off into change without thought of the potential risk--and failure. Which is human nature. And organizational nature, as well. We all seek security and predictability. For example, an employee who isn't "predictable" is... what? Unstable? A risk? Someone to watch closely? Someone who might just "change," and thus become...what? Perhaps. But this in its own way may be wrong-headed thinking. The employee who isn't "predictable" may be entirely stable, but just highly creative. And in this, a change agent. One who can lead the way through the waves of change. (This is not, how-ever, to say that the employee who is predictably un-predictable is not an issue for concern. He or she is.) Three things you don't want to do regarding organizational change: One, ignore it. Two, deny it (both of these will result in your doing something other than you're doing now and probably liking it less). And three, go about making change recklessly. There are things you can do to smooth the way through change. You can check the vast body of literature on the subject. You can go to conferences, seminars, and trade shows. There are consultants you can hire to guide you through changethe likes of the folks at Ingersoll Engineers (Rockford, IL) or Andersen Consulting (Chicago, IL). Or you can, of course, read this magazine for advice and counsel. But when it all comes down to dealing with change, perhaps the best advice is this: Never play at change. Change, like war, is an art. And once you engage in change, you must firmly remember to go with it to the very end. However, unlike war, the art of change, like change itself, never ends.

By GARY S. VASILASH, Editor-In-Chief Design for Assembly (DFA) seems to have been eclipsed by other Designs for (--Service, --Environment, --Etc.) as they have come to the fore. It is ever thus, this inexorable march of new opportunities and possibilities. But asked about the status of DFA, at least from his point of view, Dr. Peter Dewhurst, director of graduate programs at the Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering Dept. of the University of Rhode Island, and Co-founder of Boothroyd-Dewhurst, Inc. (Wakefield, RI), remarks, "DFA is at the core of what we are doing." As in, he maintains that it is the essential element, or starting point, for these newer Design for activities. Boothroyd Dewhurst, Inc. developers, continue their pursuit of improvements in this area; the latest in their line of software packages is actually DFA 8.0, which operates on Windows 95 and Windows NT. The viability of DFA is undiminished. This could be somewhat surprising, in that Dewhurst recalls that the first DFA software package appeared in 1981. "Back then, we thought we were developing tools for independent designers," he says. "It wasn't until the mid-'80s, when Design for Manufacturing and Assembly were getting use and exposure, that there was another revolution in product development going on--working as teams." He notes that the now-famous Team Taurus, which was responsible for launching what was a revolutionary car, really put this concept of working as teams on the industrial and managerial landscape. Then people started talking about "concurrent engineering" and/or "simultaneous engineering." As this turned from talk to implementation, the DFA software went from being a standalone, independent node in development to something that was a part of the mainstream. "Since that time," Dewhurst says, "it has served almost as much as a communication tool for teams as it has as an evaluation and analysis tool." "It's gone a long way in automotive," Dewhurst observes. "Most of the auto companies are at or beyond the point of getting suppliers to use DFA." As for those supplier companies that haven't started using DFA--if not the software, then at least the methodology--then it may be worthwhile, if not vital, for them to begin. "We see many products from small companies that look like prototypes rather than products that we designed for production," Dewhurst says. An objective of DFA is to create designs for products that are not only functionally efficient and easy to assemble but which are also reliable and exhibiting quality. The products that Dewhurst is referring to were undoubtedly more the result of uncoordination than method. (Actually, it is possible to take un-DFA designed parts to be redesigned with DFA. There is actually a portion of the software that Boothroyd Dewhurst offers that allows users to subject each element in a part to analysis: Is it critical or not? If critical, then it remains an independent part. If it isn't critical, then it becomes a candidate for integration with other parts or elimination. The goal is to create a product that is as simple as it can be while still having the functional and aesthetic characteristics that are required.) As Dewhurst surveys the development of the DFA software, he points out that early on there were some fundamental limits built in as related to the way assembly would be performed that didn't necessarily reflect the way assembly was actually done. For example, in the cases of bench assembly tasks, the assumption was that the parts and the tools would be readily at hand. Now users are able to input information related to the distances that the parts are actually located in or near the workstation; tool location and even type can be inputted as well. Consequently, not only is DFA about designs, but it is also a tool that can be used for assembly line balancing. (There is an extensive library system built in to the software that includes design and processing best practices.) So what about these other Designs for? Dewhurst says that about three years ago they began work on Design for Service (DFS) at the University of Rhode Island with seed money provided by Battelle Memorial Institute. One of the objectives was to look at how products could be disassembled for purposes of servicing them. DFS actually works with DFA. DFA allows a designer and/or engineer to build up a product; the same data can be used to methodically tear it down. In fact, in the software developed for DFS, it is a matter of simply pointing and clicking at the element on the product design image and the disassembly routine is created. (As for the designs: there is DFA/Pro--an integration of the Boothroyd Dewhurst DFA analysis software with Pro/engineer CAD software from Parametric Technology. Dewhurst says that EDS is developing an interface for Unigraphics CAD software.) Okay. So you have the assembly (DFA) and the disassembly (DFS) sequences. A couple of years ago, a grant from consumer electronics giant Samsung was received; that company was interested in design for the environment (DFE). So Dewhurst and his colleagues started looking at a washing machine, a television and a refrigerator from the standpoint of the end of their life possibilities. Enter the TNO Product Centre (Netherlands), an organization that, Dewhurst explains, had built up plenty of experience on life cycle analysis and data related to the environmental impacts and financial paybacks of components. So TNO and Boothroyd Dewhurst joined forces. The software package developed combines disassembly with a value assessment metric developed at TNO: MET, which stands for Materials, Energy, Toxicity. Fundamentally, in the DFE sequence, it is a matter of disassembling a product in a step-by-step manner. It can be indicated whether a particular product is to be recycled (there is a database of material scrap values) or reused (an expected value for the reused component can be entered). There are actually two bottom lines. One is a financial line. It basically provides a trade off between the disassembly labor costs and the value of what's being recovered or recycled. It can indicate where the disassembly should stop and disposal proceed if the key interest is a return on investment. The second bottom line is an environmental scoring line. "It always starts out negative," Dewhurst says. As disassembly proceeds and negative environmental effects are reversed, points are "won back." The Big Three are looking at recycling, individually and together, through the Vehicle Recycling Partnership (VRP), which is a group that operates under the United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR). One concern is that there are European regulations for some products that require that the manufacturers take back products and/or packaging for recycling and disposal, which could extend to automobiles. Consequently, auto manufacturers in Europe, manufacturers who sell products there, are looking at environmentally correct designs. "What we imagine at some point down the road," Dewhurst says, "is that there may be some environmental goalposts setup during the design stage." The DFA stage. Even at that future time, DFA will continue to matter. Here are some numbers from Booth-royd Dewhurst about the average returns that users of DFA software have realized . . . Reduction in manufacturing cycle time:57.3% Part count reduction:51.4% Part cost reduction:37% Time-to-market improvements:50% Quality and reliability improvements:68% Reduction in assembly time:62.3% Green Instrument Panel Without question, thermoplastics have become a dominant material in vehicle interiors. Think about the instrument panel (IP), for example. The people at GE Plastics (Pittsfield, MA) certainly think about IPs and thermoplastics. In May, GE Plastics awarded the University of Rhode Island's Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering Dept. with a one-year, $87,000 contract to look at instrument panels from the standpoint of environmental design. Dr. Peter Dewhurst of the University of Rhode Island says that the researchers are looking at an IP from a 1989 midsize truck and one from a current production model. The idea is to assess the ability to recover materials and instruments and to collaborate with automotive industrial designers in coming up with future IP design concepts that are both economically and environmentally correct.

The people at KPT/Kaiser Precision Tooling (Elk Grove Village), in addition to precision boring tools, handle tool presetters. Because they know that many people are best convinced through financial arguments, they have devised a simple cost payback analysis that probably will do a better job of converting doubters of the significance of off-line setups than an entire shelf of books related to Japanese manufacturing methodologies: How many machining centers do you have? On average, how many hours per shift does each operatorspend touching off tool lengths and diameters? Multiply answer 1 by answer 2. Multiply answer 3 by the number of shifts you run. Enter your spindle value per hour (i.e., burden rate plus average value of production lost per hour of spindle downtime). Multiply answer 4 by answer 5. Price of presetter. Divide answer 7 by answer 6. Answer 8 is the number of days it will take for a new presetter to pay for itself.GSV Return to Top of Page | Return to AP Technical Resource Center Page [ GardnerWeb Home | Visitors Center | Bookstore ] [ Finishing Resource Center | Metalworking Resource Center ] Serving the Metalworking and Finishing Industries.

EOC Mission Statement The Earth Observation Centre will conduct multidisciplinary, internationallycompetitive and collaborative research and development. The results of thiswill support the goals of and benefit existing CSIRO Divisions, Australianagencies and industry groups as well as potential users of information derivedfrom Earth Observation and related data." Objectives EOC Objectives To accomplish its Mission, the EOC will: 1. Work closely with other CSIRO units, Divisions and clients in Agenciesand industrial Sectors to undertake research and develop products that arebeyond the scope of single groups and to serve common interests and purpose; 2. Develop CSIRO niche activity, excellence and collaborative developmentsin international Earth Observation science by linking the efforts and skillsof scientists who are dispersed geographically and by Sector client focus; 3. Together with CSIRO Divisions, data capturing and using Agencies andindustry groups, develop standards and deliver best research practice algorithmsand techniques for value added products which in the short and long termsserve the needs of industries and groups that use Earth Observation data;and 4. Ensure access to Earth Observation data products for CSIRO researchersand other users where this is not otherwise available and work closely withthe data delivery industry to ensure that all data users have access todata of the highest quality. Threads & Focus Areas Applications Oriented Threads Most Earth Observation applications demand products that are the resultof a sequence of activities from acquisition, through base processing, interpretation(often based on modelling) and finally to product presentation. These sequenceswill be referred to as 'Threads'. The generic EOC Tasks can be seen as componentsof applications oriented Threads which map across Focus areas and retaina consistent set of 'dimensions' in terms of Target, Platform and Sensoras well as overall objective in the final products and results. Threadsare the road maps between raw data acquisition and sector oriented products. End users are interested in products and behind each product is the technologythe EOC serves. The combination and interaction of components in this technologyis the Thread. Threads will be the primary areas of concern out of whichEOC Tasks are defined and EOC products valued. Any one EOC Task can andusually will also involve a number of Threads that pass through it fromdifferent data sources and on to different types of end product. ThreadCoordination is an important activity and is between clients (who generallyrelate closely to the output end of Threads) and the EOC management. The generic research Tasks which may be each be a component of a Threadof Tasks, are grouped and monitored within four primary 'Focus' areas forgeneric Earth Observation Science: Application Support Focus Tools and Methods for: Global change Forestry & forests applications Ocean, coastal & inland waters Crops, pastures & soils Geology & minerals Measurement Models Focus Calibration & validation Geomatic measurement Atmospheric modelling & characterisation Earth surface targets models Field & laboratory procedures Data Systems Focus Archive & Access methodology Common processing software Data integration methods Measurement libraries Data security Sensor Systems Focus Imaging spectrometer support Space & airborne instruments Field instrumentation Space engineering interface These, together with three more general areas of Program Support, National and International Scientific Interaction and Application Oriented Thread Coordination comprise seven areas which provide a more aggregated and persisting basisfor project and financial planning and management.

The applicationof radar polarimetry and high precision digital elevation data is currentlyin its infancy. The proposed mission will not only build on the scientificobjectives and benefits of the 1993 Australian Mission, but will be expandedto include specific SAR science issues best addressed in countries and regionsin south-east Asia. It is anticipated that the Asia-Australia deploymentwill enable the baseline characterisation of control sites in many differentenvironments for the continued analysis of earth surface, climatic and tectonicprocesses into the period when operational datasets become available fromsatellite or airborne systems. The proposed deployment will involve numerous sites and a large number ofinvestigator from Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia,Philippines and Japan. Background The Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) was developed at the JetPropulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California and is the world's most advancedsynthetic aperture radar system. The AIRSAR system, flown in a DC-8 aircraftoperates in a full polarimetric mode at L-band (24cm), C-band (5.6 cm) andP-band (68 cm). In addition to the three-frequency polarimetric capability,the incorporation of additional C- and L-band antennas on the aircraft permitsalong-track interferometry at these frequencies resulting in the productionof TOPSAR digital elevation models. Data is digitally encoded and recorded using onboard high density digitaltape recorders and later processed into images. THE PACIFIC RIM DEPLOYMENT provides a unique opportunity to acquire dataover land and water surfaces not previously available. The potential forAIRSAR/TOPSAR includes: geologic studies embracing geomorphic studies, rock weathering and erosionalprocesses, tectonics and geologic boundaries, geobotany, radar stereogrammetry,DEM and interferometry. hydrological investigations which cover wetland, humid and arid environmentcharacterisation, and in particular, the assessment of soil moisture conditions. mapping and identifying vegetation types, assessing the biophysical propertiesof plant canopies, modelling tree morphologies and examining soil-vegetationboundary layer. oceanographic studies to analyse ocean wave spectra, internal wave-currentinteraction and detection of current-system boundaries, oceanic fronts andmesoscale eddies. Advantages and Applications of AIRSAR/TOPSAR Data Imaging radar is an all-weather imaging tool. AIRSAR's multiple capabilities -- polarimetry, interferometry, multifrequency- have widened the range of applications for imaging radar measurements. Multi-frequency radar images can classify a vegetation cover more easilythan single-frequency radar images. Soil moisture level (top few cm) and canopy water content can be estimatedfrom polarimetry data. Radar backscatter measurements can be related to biomass (up to ~200tonnes/hectare) with accuracy within 20% of absolute biomass. AIRSAR can penetrate vegetation canopies, revealing inundation. AIRSAR can penetrate dry soil, revealing buried structures. AIRSAR' interferometry mode produces high-resolution (2 - 5 m) topographicmap. By combining polarinietry data and interferometry data, one can estimatetree heights and the underlying surface topography. Correlation data from TOPSAR mode can be used for land classification. Along-track interferometry can measure current velocity in the radarline-of-sight direction.

The meeting will discussplans for ensuring that international co-operation in Earth observationfrom space will continue to improve. Most international space agencies are eithermembers or affiliates of CEOS, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites,an international organisation for remote-sensing co-operation. CSIRO's DrBrian Embleton chairs the group. "Attendees at the last meeting, inMontreal, elected CSIRO to lead CEOS throughout 1996" said Dr Embleton. "The election is international recognitionof CSIRO's commitment to deliver environmental and social benefits fromspace technology." The meeting will include the world's firstdemonstration of transferring "live" satellite observations fromone continent to another. The Hatoyama ground station in Japan willrelay incoming data from the Japanese ADEOS satellite to a screen at Canberra'sNational Convention Centre. "Delegates will literally feel asthough they are in the spacecraft looking down at Japan," said Scienceand Technology Minister Peter McGauran, who yesterday announced detailsof the event. Space organisations in India, Japan, Chinaand Australia will take part in the demonstration. CEOS is an informal association of worldspace agencies, founded in 1984. Members work towards matching future Earthobservation projects with data users' needs. CSIRO joined CEOS in 1989. "CSIROrepresents other Australian Earth observation bodies, and we share our experiencethrough CEOS for international benefit," said Dr Embleton. CSIRO will also release an educationalCD-ROM at the meeting. Aimed at developing-nations and schools, the CD willuse case studies to illustrate the social benefits of Earth observation. The CD will contain information previouslytoo expensive, obscure or inaccessible to be readily useable in educationalcircles or in remote areas. Notes for media: 1. A media conference will be held 0830-0915,13 November, in the Fitzroy Room, National Convention Centre, Canberra.Senior officials from major space agencies, including NASA, European SpaceAgency, the National Space Development Agency of Japan and CSIRO will answerquestions about their plans in Earth observation. A list of officials participating in themedia conference, with their titles and brief cv, is available from COSSA. Please note the Plenary sessions are closedto media. Some space agency officials are willing to be interviewed at arrangedtimes. Contact COSSA for information. 2. Video footage is available (approx.8 minutes, in VHS PAL format).

In a world-first demonstration, "live"pictures taken by the Japanese Midori ("Green") satellite weretransmitted from Hatoyama ground station near Tokyo, to Canberra's NationalConvention Centre. Midori (also known as ADEOS, or Advanced Earth ObservingSatellite) was launched on 17 August from Tanegashima Space Center. Scientists and space agency officials fromover thirty countries, meeting in Australia for the first time, have beendiscussing better ways of organising the world's Earth observing effort,to support scientific research, resource monitoring, and other applicationsof satellite measurements of the world's oceans, atmosphere, ice caps andground surfaces. In conjunction with other groups, CEOS - the Committeeon Earth Observation Satellites - has also been considering how space-basedmeasurements can best complement those made from the air, sea or ground,in order to meet the requirements of users of geographically-based information. Most of the world's space agencies aremembers of CEOS, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites, an internationalorganisation for remote-sensing co-operation. CSIRO's Dr Brian Embletonwas elected Chair of CEOS at the last meeting, in Montreal last year. "The election was international recognitionof CSIRO's commitment to deliver environmental and social benefits fromspace technology,' said Dr Embleton. "Data management networks, like theone demonstrated today in Canberra, will enable researchers around the worldwill be able to share the same observations. Users will be able to preview,order and use data stored anywhere in the world," he said. Space organisations in India, Japan, Chinaand Australia will take part in the demonstration, which was organised byCSIRO and the Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Computational Systems. CEOS is an informal association of worldspace agencies, founded in 1984. CSIRO joined CEOS in 1989, and representsEarth observation organisations from Australia. CEOS members work towardsmatching future Earth observation projects with data users' needs.

The disk contains sample data from satellitesoperated by members of CEOS, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites,whose annual meeting concluded in Canberra today. The disk also includes lesson plans,text books, case studies, glossaries and contact address information tohelp inexperienced users of remote sensing discover how to find drinkingwater in India; how to locate the source of the Amazon; to manage fish stocksin Tanzania; and how grass and forest fires in China can be located andcontrolled, through the help of images of the Earth obtained from satellites. The project was managed by the CSIROOffice of Space Science & Applications, building on work of the Scienceand Technology Agency of Japan, the Indian Space Research Organisation,and other international space agencies and research organisations, whichcontributed data and information on the disk. CSIRO Chief Executive, Dr MalcolmMcIntosh, who launched the CD today in Canberra, said "The CD containsinformation previously too expensive, obscure or inaccessible to be readilyuseable in educational circles or in remote areas". "The case studies containedon the disk show practical benefits from space technology, advancing qualityof life and supporting sustainable development. The new Australian spaceprogram, centred on the FEDSAT project to build small but useful satellites,will follow the a similar approach", said Dr McIntosh. Dr Brian Embleton, Head of the CSIROOffice of Space Science and Applications, said "This CD is likely tobenefit developing countries, where the price of remotely sensed data precludesit from being used as much as it should be. Similarly, schools throughoutthe world will be able to use these teaching materials to study advancedspace technologies and their practical applications. Copies of the CD are available,at $20 each including postage, from The Information Officer, CSIRO Officeof Space Science and Applications GPO Box 3023, Canberra ACT 2601,fax 06 2167222.

"The first satellite will be orbited during the centenary of Federationin 2001," Mr McGauran said. "Our predecessors in the Labor Government effectively abolished theNational Space Program by terminating its funding. "Despite the stringent Budget conditions faced by the Howard Government,we have been able to establish a space research program that is practicaland will meet Australia's specific needs. "The space mission, to be known as FEDSAT, will conduct scientificexperiments and develop practical applications such as communications andearth observation. I have asked CSIRO to play a leading role in this effortand to develop a research plan that will include universities and industry." The microsatellite program is an integral part of a Cooperative ResearchCentre proposal being prepared by CSIRO in consultation with appropriatepartners. This CRC will develop and operate payloads for the FEDSAT mission. "Australia needs more experience in space projects," said Mr McGauran. "We will gain this in a focused, step by step fashion, drawing on expertisealready in CSIRO and our universities, and involving those companies willingto share some of the costs. This new program will develop our experiencein managing real space projects, and will reduce the risk involved in themore demanding and complex space projects we may want to pursue later. "There are many Government departments and agencies which use spaceto deliver services like communications, weather forecasting, environmentalmonitoring, navigation and search and rescue. "The Government will use these resources more effectively. "Synergies can be developed by these organisations working togetherwith Australian companies and researchers." To maximise the benefits of space and its applications to Australia willrequire a whole-of-Government view of current trends in Australia and overseas. The Government will establish a Space Policy Unit within the Departmentof Industry, Science and Tourism to maintain an overview of national andinternational space activities and set policy in the national interest. "The Space Policy Unit will provide advice on space policy and facilitatecommercial space activities and interaction with other governments whichgo beyond the role and responsibilities of individual organisations currentlyinvolved in space research," Mr McGauran said. "There are, for example, space launch proposals for Australia which,if they come to fruition, will give rise to a range of policy issues whichwill need to be dealt with by the Government." In recognition of the Governmentís approach, the Chief Executiveof CSIRO, Dr Malcolm McIntosh, has agreed to widen representation on theAdvisory Board of the CSIRO Office of Space Science and Applications (COSSA)to include external groups. There is no further role for the Australian Space Council.

The Minister for Science, the Hon Peter McGauran MP, has called upon CSIROto become the Australian space agency. CSIRO's new role, to be managed byCOSSA, will include responsibility for arranging international and nationalcooperation in space projects. The most exciting news, however, is the announcement of a new program todevelop, launch and operate scientific microsatellites, the first by 2001. This effort will be managed by COSSA, with support from the Australian SpaceResearch Institute Ltd and other groups. COSSA, with ASRI, will prepareover the next few months a proposal for a Co-operative Research Centre inMicrosatellite Applications. This is expected to provide $10 m in new funding,over 5 years. CSIRO Chief Executive Dr Malcolm McIntosh has expressed strong support forthis new charter for CSIRO, and COSSA. I have guaranteed COSSA's full commitment to this task, which will not decreaseour commitment to the Earth Observation Centre. For any further information, please contact: 1.

Satellite technology is coming of age in assisting farmers and miners, andin environmental and climate monitoring, where Australia has special requirementsthat can not always be fulfilled by other nations' satellites. The micro satellite mission, to be known as FEDSAT, wiil conduct scientificexperiments to prepare for practical applications such as earth observationand communications. The first satellite will be orbited during the centenary of Federation in2001. The microsatellite program is to be an integral part of a Cooperative ResearchCentre proposal being prepared by CSIRO in collaboration with appropriatepartners. The restructuring is, however, more fundamental than this one project. Asmall Space Policy Unit will be established in the Department of Industry,Science and Tourism to maintain an overview of international space activitiesand set policy in the national interest. The Minister has made clear that CSIRO will have prime responsibility forplanning and executing space programs on behalf of the Government, in conjunctionwith other Departments and instrumentalities that use space, universitiesand industry. A Space Activities Board will be set up by CSIRO involving these groupsand the Space Policy Unit. The Minister will chair meetings of the Boardfrom time to time to assess progress and guide future directions. The Minister has agreed to transfer to CSIRO the activities of the NASAtracking station at Tidbinbilla to facilitate greater synergy with CSIRO'sexisting world class radio astronomy and radio physics activities. The Chief Executive of CSIRO, Dr Malcolm Mcintosh, in welcoming these enhancementsfrom the Minister, emphasised that it would be a cooperative activity involvingall those with a contribution to make.

These data sets frequentlyhave long-term value, for applications which may not have been apparentat the time of commencement of the research projects which generated them. Data sets generated by one Division or research project may have value toother parts of the Organisation, to other Australian agencies, or to foreignorganisations. Therefore, provided the existence of research data collectionsis known, they may be utilised as national or global information resourceswhich can be expanded and checked. Timely access to existing research datasets may decrease the current costs of research, and may increase the measurementperiod (and possibly the accuracy) for some experiments. I am writing to inform you of several exciting developments in the managementof spatially-referenced information (Attachment 1). Many of these advancesoriginated in space programs, where the unit cost of data is often veryhigh and measurements may be not easily repeatable. Other breakthroughshave originated at the public policy level, or from integration of severaltechnologies, including the Internet, data visualisation, and database design. The net effect is to make it easier to locate, browse, select and transferinformation held at distributed sites. This capacity is of special valuefor fusing multi-disciplinary datasets relating to the same geographic location,and for datasets which are expensive or which need specialised storage facilities. If you find this work to be relevant to your Division's current or plannedresearch, I would encourage you to contact me for further information.

Data from the Japanese Meteorological Satellite (GMS) for abenchmark period (1 July 1994 - 31 December 1995) will be examined (bothGMS-4 and GMS-5). Sources of noise in the data (e.g., stripes) will be removed, accurate clouddetection algorithms will be developed, radiometric calibration of the datawill be performed and validated using field observations being planned andimplemented by CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Sciences, CSIRO Office of SpaceScience & Applications/Earth Observation Centre, the Bureau of Meteorology,and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Contemporaneous GOES observations (GOES-7 and GOES-8) also will be processedand radiometrically calibrated using procedures developed during the initialGOES Pathfinder Benchmark period (1987-1988) by Simpson et. al., 1995; Simpsonand Gobat, 1995a,b; and Frouin and Simpson, 1995. This project will modifythe GOES-7 procedure to accommodate and make optional use of new informationcontained in the GOES-8 and GOES-9 (GVAR) and the GMS data. A cross calibrationbetween the GOES and GMS data and between GMS and NOAA AVHRR data for theperiod also is planned so that composite products of interest to the globalchange community can be made. To demonstrate the scientific usefulness ofthe GMS/GOES data resulting from this project, we will: a) examine ENSOdevelopment and propagation from the Indonesian Basin to the west coastof North America; and b) examine ENSO related land vegetation changes onthe Australian continent. The data sets, software, and documentation developed as part of this projectby Scripps will be made available to both the NASA designated DAAC and toCSIRO/BoM in Australia. Likewise, relevant software and datasets developedby Australia will be made available to Scripps and the NASA designated DAAC. REFERENCES: Simpson, J.J., J.I. Gobat and R. Frouin.

What is the GMS Pathfinder? A group of research agencies, universities and government organisationsin Australian and the USA commenced the "GMS Pathfinder Project"in 1995. The initial phase is expected to last until 1997. The project'sobjectives are to extend the useful lifetime, and the productivity, of climatedata derived from time-series observations from the Japanese Himawari orGeostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) series. Using peer review and inter-agency co-operation, the group will be applyingnewer computing systems and more advanced methods, in order to systematicallyre-process archived GMS data, initially for a "benchmark" periodof 18 months, from 1 July 1994 to 31 December 1995, a period which includesthe introduction of a more sophisticated sensor to the GMS series. Afterevaluation of the scientific integrity of data products for the benchmarkperiod, a decision will be made on whether to extend the re-processing tocover a more extensive period, possibly 1987-1997. It is hoped that this work will verify the utility, for climate and globalchange research, of quantitative long term satellite measurements over theEastern Hemisphere. The GMS Pathfinder project , we hope, will increasethis utility, through the provision to the international research communityof more accurately navigated, better calibrated, more certainly classified,and more readily accessible, data sets for the study of global change andclimate. About GMS The Himawari, or Geostationary Meteorological Satellite series, havesupplied continuous medium-resolution (1-5 km) data of the entire EasternHemisphere, at high temporal frequency (0.5 - 3 hours), since the FirstGlobal Atmospheric Research Program Global Experiment (FIGGE) in 1978. Timeseries data from these satellites offers by far the longest sequence ofalbedo and infra-red observations of the Oceania and western Pacific area. Versions of the Japanese-built satellite were launched in 1977, 1980, 1989,1993, and 1995. Table 1 gives launchand payload details, while Table 2 summarisesthe characteristics of the primary payload, the Visible and Infrared SpinScan Radiometer (VISSR). Figure 1 shows the orbital characterisitics.

Regional studieshave also demonstrated the power of using long time series satellite datafor change detection (Graetz et al 1992). However, the technologicalevolution of sensors on research satellite missions means that there arefew instances of stable instrument configuration over a sufficiently longtime period to be useful for global change research. Growing recognition of the power of long-time series satellite data forglobal climate studies - and emerging understanding of the need of satellitedata management agencies to evolve more efficient practices in the faceof exploding volumes and data rates of Earth observation data - led theUS National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration (NASA and NOAA) to establish in 1990 "Pathfinder"retrospective satellite data processing projects. Typically, the projectsevolved in four stages (Booth & Maiden, 1993): Step 1. Identify data sets suitable for supporting climate and global changeresearch Step 2. Transfer minimally processed archive data to working medium Step 3. Develop "scientific community consensus" to define necessarydata products and determine quality control and validation procedures Step 4. Generate, validate, and disseminate the agreed products on readilyaccessible distribution media and with supporting metadata/browse support. Because scientific understanding and technical means in processing and storagemedia have evolved, Steps 2-4 often require reprocessing of older data usingimproved and consistent algorithms, and/or conversion of archival data media.This frequently has the additional advantage of prolonging data life; reducinghandling costs; and allowing more efficient use. NASA and NOAA have established a number of "Pathfinder" projectsto generate multi-year data from AVHRR, GOES, TOVS, and the Special SensorMicrowave Imager (UCAR, 1994). GMS Pathfinder The GMS Pathfinder, the first in the eastern Hemisphere, was initiated byCSIRO Office of Space Science & Applications (COSSA) in 1994, followinga meeting of a technical working group of the Committee on Earth ObservationSatellites (CEOS) Working Group on Data at Saõ José dos Campos.This meeting noted the importance of the GOES Pathfinder project for thedeveloping sound practice in the management of long-term, consistently-calibratedsatellite datasets. The meeting encouraged the development of complementarydata sets leading to the creation - and widespread availability for globalchange studies - of global coverage, long time series satellite data ofconsistent quality, low cost and easily usable transfer media. CEOS is an informal, "best efforts" organisation, through whichparticipating agenices - typically, space agencies, international researchbodies, and operational agencies of the UN family - try to achieve the mosteffective match between planned Earth-observing space missions on the onehand, and the requirements of Earth observation data users (such as theWorld Meteorological Organization and the Global Climate Observing System)on the other (CEOS, 1995). The group is chaired in 1995/96by CSIRO. CEOS, through its Working Group on Information Systems and Services, alsopromotes the preservation of archived Earth observation satellite observationsand the adoption, by Earth observation satellite data management agencies,of consistent practice in data format, networks, collection of auxilliarydata, and service provision. The Working Group on Calibration and Validationdevsies and implements international best practice in the verification ofquantitiative measurements from satellite sensors. In October 1994, CSIRO and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology jointlyproposed, for consideration by the Japan Meteorological Agency which operatesGMS, a "GMS Pathfinder" project (Kingwell et al, 1994).Following the acceptance in principle of the project by JMA, the NASA Officeof Mission to Planet Earth approved funding for participation in the projectby Scripps Institution of Oceanography (Butler, 1995). This stepwas important, since it ensured that lessons of the GOES Pathfinder projectwould be absorbed in the GMS work (eg, Simpson & Globat, 1995a, b;Frouin & Simpson, 1995; Simpson, Gobat & Frouin, 1995, throughwhich work improved methods were identified for operationally removing imageartefacts [striping] caused by sensor characterisitics; for better radiometriccalibration; and for improved cloud detection). Application of these approaches to the historic, but poorly previously utilisedGMS archive, would together with the GOES Pathfinder data set, provide consistent,accessible and well-documented data products for climate and global changestudies over the greater part of the Earth's surface. In 1995, the CSIRO Office of Space Science and Applications invited theDr John Le Marshall of the Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre, to chaira GMS Pathfinder Science Working Group, to oversee the selection of processingalgorithms; the implementation of a processing and data management system;and a portfolio of research projects utilising the Pathfinder benchmarkdata (Embleton, 1995). Apart from CSIRO (represented by the new EarthObservation Centre) and the Bureau, participants are drawn from NASA, anduniversities in Australia and the USA. A close relationship is expectedto develop between the group and the Japan Meteorological Agency. A listingof membership of the Science Working Group is given at Attachment1, while the tasks of the group are given at Attachment2. Conclusion The GMS Pathfinder represents a new, systematic, and exciting approach tothe use of satellite data for climate and global change research in Australia.If successful, the completion of the benchmark period of 1 July 1994 to31 December 1995 will result in much improved access, all over the world,to a quality, high spatial and temporal data set of science products derivedfrom the GMS satellite program.

The resultant Commonwealth Public InterestSpatial Data Transfer Policy and the Guidelines for Commonwealth Data Custodianscover, respectively, the exchange principles and the operational proceduresrecommended for Commonwealth agencies which deal with data collected, eitherunder Ministerial direction or via a legislative basis, with the intentionof making them public. The CSIRO Office of Space Science & Applications represents CSIRO interestson the CSDC. At a Federal level, Commonwealth and State views on land-related data exchange(including price and third-party disclosure provisions) are aggregated bythe Australia and New Zealand Land Information Council (ANZLIC). ANZLIC,through a process of consultation with data users, has developed a set offundamental attributes for describing datasets (the Core Metadata Elements).This core list of descriptors is similar to the Directory Interchange Format[DIF] used by international spatial data centres to make a self-sufficiententry into a Directory - an annotated list of data sets and contact information. The National Resource Information Centre (NRIC) maintains the National Directoryof Australian Resources (NDAR) to support decision making within the Departmentof Primary Industries and Energy. NRIC has agreed to maintain a Directoryof Commonwealth spatial data sets on behalf of the CSDC, and this will becomea major component of NDAR. NRIC is currently re-developing NDAR and accessallowing simple search strategies is available on-line via the NRICísweb site. International DIRECTORIES OF DATA COLLECTIONS The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), of which CSIRO ischair, has been developing Internet-based data directories for several years.The CEOS International Directory Network (IDN) permits location of Earthand space science data sets through over 15 participating directory nodesaround the world. This effort is conducted through the CEOS Working Groupon Information Systems and Services, with CSIRO participation co-ordinatedthrough COSSA, the Australian CEOS Plenary member. The CEOS Working Group on Information Systems and Services has also developedsoftware tools through which data custodians can generate Directory InterchangeFormat (DIF) entries to log information about their datasets onto the InternationalDirectory Network. COSSA has established an Australian co-operating node for this network,which will enable users to access a full copy of the Global Master Directorymaintained by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, as well as any additionalAustralian directory entries. Local installation of the Master Directory has the advantage of much reduced network access time, and lower communicationcost to users. COSSA would welcome approaches from other Divisions/Units interested inhaving an International Directory entry for their spatially related datasets.This entry (but not necessarily the dataset itself) would be available tonational or international inquirers. It is important to note that this stepwould simply provide basic information about the nature of the data set(time period, sensors used, availability criteria, contact details, etc.).Control of the dataset would remain with the custodian Division/unit. We could also undertake conversion of such entries into a form usable bythe National Directory being developed by NRIC. This step would help streamlineinteraction with between NRIC and CSIRO. We also discussing, with NRIC,establishing a link between NDAR and the IDN, so that a user accessing theIDN could conveniently cross to NDAR. The group on industrialised economies, G7, has established a prototype Environmentand Natural Resources Management Global Information Locator service (ENRMGIL), which builds upon the work of CEOS and individual space agencies.This is a free of charge pilot project based at the European CommissionísCentre for Earth Observation. Software from this program is being incorporatedinto an Information Locator Service pilot project being led by the GermanSpace Agency, DARA, and directed primarily at developing countries. COSSAis participating in this project, through CEOS. The value of these effortslies in increasing CSIRO access to important research data from developingcountries (such as that relating to local impact of global and climate change),as well as in allowing developing countries to improve their own researchcapabilities. ACCESS TO DATA AND INFORMATION NASA is building a comprehensive system for managing images and relateddata products from its Earth Observing System of satellites. The initialversion of this system allows on-line searching [by various strategies includingdate, sensor, latitude/longitude range and place name], browse, inventorymanagement, and ordering. These functions go several steps beyond the Directoryfunctions of the IDN or NDAR, since they permit actual examination of theinformation (for example, images from Earth observing satellites), priorto an authorised user logging a request for on or off-line delivery of thechosen data. In collaboration with NASA, COSSA will soon install a copy of the EarthObserving Systemís data management system, initially primarily forinventory control of NOAA AVHRR images from the Global 1 Km AVHRR Land Dataproject, and for managing other satellite data set corporate assets. Both the data management system and the International Directory Networknode at COSSA will be demonstrated at the CEOS Plenary, to be chaired byCSIRO in Canberra this November. These demonstrations, managed by the Divisionof Information Technology, will also include aspects of real-time transmissionof global satellite data and distributed data processing techniques. CSIRO Earth Observation Centre Dr David Jupp, the Centreís Science Leader, will be initiating anumber of research planning workshops over the next few months. The CentreísStrategic Science Plan includes a Data Systems focus, and this will benefitfrom many of the initiatives discussed above. Through workshops and otherdiscussions involving participating Divisions, specific research tasks willbe developed in an effort to further improve the quality of remotely senseddata products, and to increase their usefulness both to CSIRO and the widercommunity.

The application ofearth observing technologies throughout our region and the world will bea major activity as resource and environmental assessment and monitoringis required at many scales and over vast areas of the land and ocean. Australiawill certainly be a developer of advanced methods and technologies for EarthObservation, surveillance and monitoring from satellite and aircraft platformsand may well have a developing satellite launch, sensors, and services industry.In addition, in an era of data encryption and 'closeable' skies, Australiawill need to gather, process and interpret a significant amount of its ownresource and environmental data and information. In order to show leadership in this area, Australian scientists includingthose of us in CSIRO and Australian industry must decide that we are tobe more than a launch site provider, data consumer and user of other nations'technology. Australian industry must 'take charge' of the innovation thatis needed to own the advances that will emerge. Industry and scientistsmust work together to make the results of research create competitive advantagesthrough products having the highest quality and meeting the strictest internationalstandards. Showing national leadership in this task is a role CSIRO canand should take. The need for a CSIRO Earth Observation Centre (EOC) has developed as theefficiencies and value of focussing the skills of CSIRO scientists in EarthObservation Science on that task of 'taking charge' has become clear andthe disadvantages of dispersed and separated activities is patent. Modernearth observing research has at the same time advanced from descriptiveearth 'observation' through an era of data gathering and exploratory imageprocessing to a point where the value of remote sensing data as measurementsis paramount. Remotely sensed measurements can be collected in a range ofdata dimensions and at time and space scales which cannot be accessed inany other way. This has enabled geographical applications of Earth Observationto proceed in terms of scientific models and process understanding. Thephysical link between the data and the parameters of interest to users isproviding the returns that previous image processing and 'correlation' basedapproaches could only suggest as being possible. In the generic developmentof this opportunity a CSIRO EOC can create a base of knowledge that willunderpin the activities of the applications oriented CSIRO Divisions aswell as provide the growing value added industry with a competitive advantage. A catalyst for an EOC was provided by the review of the COSSA multi-DivisionalProgram, MDP19 (Simpson et al., 1995). In that review the authorsrecommended that CSIRO's efforts in data acquisition and handling be redefinedand enhanced by greater collaboration and rationalisation plus much greateremphasis on algorithm development and value adding. In the pursuit of theReport's primary recommendation, to form an EOC, it was realised that theneed for focus and collaboration extended well beyond data acquisition -which is, in the end, primarily an Agency responsibility. The developmentof an EOC founded on generic, multi-disciplinary and cross-Divisional issuesincluding scene and environmental measurement models and algorithms wasperceived as a basis for developing collaboration and rationalisation throughoutthe Earth Observation activities of CSIRO. EOC projects will be outcomeoriented and collaborative, involve selection of the best teams with theoutcomes owned by the participating groups. The move to form an EOC hasrecognised that there are tasks in the application of Earth Observationscience that are common to many groups and many purposes and that focussingteams on resolving these issues is vital to the needs of all but beyondthe capacity of any one current group. In particular, the need for special focus on generic Earth Observation scienceis paramount to the successful development of clients and markets in theSectors addressed by CSIRO Divisions and the Australian product deliveryindustry. These developments and client acceptance of the products are currentlyhighly sensitive to the quality of the data products and value adding andhence to focussed input from the base of excellent scientists that CSIROhas in Earth Observation. The 'delivery ratio' of generic research to marketsatisfaction can be very high. CSIRO has an opportunity for niche developmentin generic Earth Observation science and the provision of Best Practicemethods which have immediate payoffs in environmental and resource applicationsand to the developing space and aircraft based mapping and monitoring industries. Following discussions between potential participating groups, a SciencePlan has been developed and has been discussed widely in CSIRO. This documentis the outcome of that discussion and it has taken the input material andthe responses of many scientists and groups interested in the EOC. It representsthe strategic plan on which an Earth Observation Centre will tackle thechallenges of the coming years and seek to generate a centre of scientificexcellence which has highly visible impact on the work of CSIRO Divisionsthe applications industries that use Earth Observation data and value addedproducts based on that data. By the year 2000 this Plan seeks to help Australia'sefforts in the field of Earth Observation from space and aircraft platformsand the associated services industries to be recognised and successful throughoutour region and a leader in worldwide applications. It provides a means tosee CSIRO excellence become standard practice in the industries addressedby CSIRO Divisions and in the information delivery industry that Australiahas and will develop in the coming years.

CSIRO EARTH OBSERVATION CENTRE 1.1 Place in CSIRO The EOC is a functional CSIRO research and development unit addressing andsupporting the successful application of Earth Observation information ina wide range of applications. It will seek to generate excellent and highquality scientific results that serve to promote Australia's future withinthe context of the aims of CSIRO which are to provide: benefit to Australia's industry and economy environmental benefit to Australia social benefit to Australians support to Australian national and international objectives. (CSIRO Executive Forum, June 1995) The Vision, Mission and general Objectives by which the unit will seek tosupport these general CSIRO aims in its focus areas in the years between1996 and 2000 are as follows: 1.2 EOC Vision Statement To ensure that Australia gains maximum benefit through the development andapplication of advanced technology based on Earth Observation data. 1.3 EOC Mission Statement The Earth Observation Centre will conduct multidisciplinary, internationallycompetitive and collaborative research and development. The results of thiswill support the goals of and benefit existing CSIRO Divisions, Australianagencies and industry groups as well as potential users of information derivedfrom Earth Observation and related data. 1.4 EOC Objectives To accomplish this Mission, the EOC will: 1. Work closely with other CSIRO units, Divisions and clientsin Agencies and industrial Sectors to undertake research and develop productsthat are beyond the scope of single groups and to serve common interestsand purpose; 2. Develop CSIRO niche activity, excellence and collaborative developmentsin international Earth Observation science by linking the efforts and skillsof scientists who are dispersed geographically and by Sector client focus; 3. Together with CSIRO Divisions, data capturing and using Agencies andindustry groups, develop standards and deliver best research practice algorithmsand techniques for value added products which in the short and long termsserve the needs of industries and groups that use Earth Observation data;and 4. Ensure access to Earth Observation data products for CSIRO researchersand other users where this is not otherwise available and work closely withthe data delivery industry to ensure that all data users have access todata of the highest quality.

ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES 2.1 Integrated Management The CSIRO Office of Space Science and Applications provides shared facilities,infrastructure and support for the EOC. COSSA and the EOC share the sameHead as well as common goals in their areas of common interest in spaceactivities and national and international liaison. COSSA and the EOC havecomplementary missions and will work without boundaries to achieve them. 2.2 Scientific Leadership The EOC is set up to bring the skills of CSIRO scientists together in outcomeoriented and cooperative projects to foster research excellence in EarthObservation science and provide national leadership in the foundation scientificknowledge serving this area of activity. 2.3 Client Applications Focus The client focus of the EOC will include CSIRO Divisions, Software and hardware suppliers Consultants, Fegeral and State Agencies (eg ERIN, NRIC, BRS) Data providers Universities and other educational institutions and the Value Added industry that delivers or uses Earth Observation products. These clients often support a variety of end uses with their data and valueadded products. The EOC will act to underpin this broad delivery industrythrough the excellence of CSIRO research and developments and the qualityof products this creates. The Earth Observation data provision and user industry comprises a diverserange of groups. There are those that generate raw data, those that collect,process and archive it into base data (such as the Bureau of Meteorologyand ACRES), those that develop it into higher level products as well asthose that produce value added products and deliver them to the end usercommunity. Their markets include: Mapping & assessment; Meteorology; Land resources & monitoring; Water resources; Agricultural resources; Rangelands; Forestry & forest systems; Coastal, marine & estuarine environment; Catchments & water quality; and Environmental impact. In general, this end user community is product oriented and not concernedwith the data sources or the 'threads' of processing methodologies but ratherin the utility of the end result and its validity. The types of end productthat Earth Observation data can be used to deliver and the issues of itsvalidity and quality are therefore primary to EOC goals and priority setting. A key characteristic of Earth Observation applications is that they occurat spatial scales ranging from less than a metre to hundreds of kiometresand time scales from seconds to decades. To encompass this scale, the toolsof earth observation include airborne and spaceborne instruments of manykinds and require the combined skills and knowledge of people ranging frominstrument engineer to end user. 2.4 Science Review Panel In addition to the COSSA Steering Committee, the EOC has a Science ReviewPanel consisting of a balance of scientific peers with national and internationalstanding and its client groups. The Science Review Panel plays a key rolein priority setting, project initiation and performance review. It willalso be asked to provide objective scientific evaluation of the performanceof the EOC. The makeup of the Panel (other than the Director of COSSA andthe EOC Science Program Leader) will change every one or two years. The makeup of the committee will be: Independently elected Chairman Head of COSSA Science Program Leader, EOC Agency Client Representative (eg Bureau of Meteorology) Industry/Divisional Client Representative International Scientific Representatives (2) International Agency Representative 2.5 Funding The sources of funding for EOC activities can come from EOC core funds whichare allocated to focus areas by the COSSA Steering Committee; contributionsfrom participating Divisions based on their Sector activity; contributionsfrom other participating groups; or external support sought by the EOC onbehalf of all the contributing groups to a particular activity. Equity and return are defined against the contributions of the participantsand the objectives of the participants and their client groups. In general,contributions from the client industrial sectors will be sought when theproducts are immediately useful and beneficial to them whereas base EOCfunds will generally be used to support more strategic activities and activitieswith longer term benefits. Intellectual Property is owned on the basis ofcontributions which will be agreed in the development of the collaborativeproject plans.

ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES (continued) 2.6 Priority Setting 2.6.1 EOC Tasks The primary activities and cost units, or Tasks, of the EOC will be of threemain types. These are: 1. Working Groups - explorations of issues and EO science problemsby groups from the EOC, contributing Divisions and other contributing groups.Recommendations are considered relative to support and priorities and maylead to Science Projects and/or Implementation Teams. The results will bepublished by the EOC; 2. Science Projects - teams of scientists from the EOC, Divisionsand other groups that come togther to resolve issues, develop algorithms,devise methods and/or standards. Science Projects are outcome oriented andcollaborative. Output is reported in the scientific literature and is publicdomain; 3. Implementation Teams - Working Groups and/or Science Projectscan lead to specific outcomes which may need implementing (eg as software,manuals, official standards) or technology transfer. Some activities maybe commercial. The products in this case may or may not be public domainwhich will be decided as part of the task planning and approval process. The EOC Tasks are the basic management unit and make up the science workingarea. The Tasks will be managed by a Task Leader and will have a scientificand financial beginning, middle and end with pre-defined outcomes and measuresof performance. The Task Leader will be responsible to the EOC Science ProgramLeader. The Tasks will be defined generally in terms of three 'dimensions' of: the earth surface or atmospheric targets they observe; the platform(s) from which the observations take place; and the sensor system(s) involved. For example, the characterisation of atmospheric water vapour and aerosolsmay relate to satellite data and specifically to data collected by the AVHRRsensors. On the other hand, the study may take into account a range of platformsand sensors but be specific to a land surface type. Alternatively, a Taskmay relate to generic issue common to wide areas of the task 'space' (suchas sensor specification, surface emissivity or surface reflectance). 2.6.2 Applications Oriented Threads Most Earth Observation applications demand products that are the resultof a sequence of activities from acquisition, through base processing, interpretation(often based on modelling) and finally to product presentation. These sequenceswill be referred to as 'Threads'. The generic EOC Tasks can be seen as componentsof applications oriented Threads which map across Focus areas and retaina consistent set of 'dimensions' in terms of Target, Platform and Sensoras well as overall objective in the final products and results. Threadsare the road maps between raw data acquisition and sector oriented products. End users are interested in products and behind each product is the technologythe EOC serves. The combination and interaction of components in this technologyis the Thread. Threads will be the primary areas of concern out of whichEOC Tasks are defined and EOC products valued. Any one EOC Task can andusually will also involve a number of Threads that pass through it fromdifferent data sources and on to different types of end product. ThreadCoordination is an important activity and is between clients (who generallyrelate closely to the output end of Threads) and the EOC management. For example, a Thread may involve the production of NDVI or land surfacetemperature products for crop monitoring from AVHRR (Land Targets, NOAAplatform, AVHRR sensor). Many of the tasks along such a Thread will be genericand can be considered along with activities relating to MODIS, AATSR, GMS,and even AVHRR to provide Sea Surface Temperatures or a number of otherproducts. The NDVI product can be a component of global change as well asvegetation monitoring but the EOC will define, develop and extend its Tasksas those which are generic and common to many applications oriented Threads.In many cases, some or most of the Tasks can be done by the end user orclient. The job is to uncover the generic Tasks where a Focus of actionwill maximise the benefits over many Threads and to the benefit of manyoutcomes. 2.6.3 Working Groups as entry points The Working Group is the essential initial step in developing generic Tasksfrom the applications oriented Threads and is the entry point for all approvedTasks. The results of the Working Groups form the basis for priority setting.Working Groups identify and help rank issues and (following prioritisation)lead to the selected focus activities of the EOC. As outlined above, theseare Science Projects and/or Implementation Teams. Science Projects resolvethe scientific issues and publish results. Implementation Teams may takethe results from the Science Project and implement then (for example) assoftware or develop a technology transfer strategy. The outcomes of thescience teams will be formal scientific publications but those of the implementationteams may not be. For example, Implementation Teams may involve commercialsoftware houses working with scientists to provide products that are documented,quality controlled and work correctly. The Working Groups offer an opportunity for scientists in different Divisions,the EOC and from other groups to develop collaboration and locate majorcentres of expertise and interest. The projects selected will seek the bestteams and be subject to approval in competition with other Working Groupoutcomes. The priority setting and approval process for the Science Projectsand Implementation Teams that arise from this activity will be explicitand include specific identification of deliverables and milestones. The EOC has a central location in Canberra where a critical mass of scientistswill tackle generic science issues and algorithm development. However, locationsof EOC project and implementation activities can also be decided by infrastructureand core staff locations and be potentially at any location with adequateresearch support among CSIRO sites. The key characteristics of EOC projectsare collocation of scientists, efficient use of resources, inter-Divisionalcollaboration, support for the goals of the EOC and a generic Earth ObservationScience focus that provides support across different applications and/orinvolves a range of tools. As stated above, the proposals for Science Projects and/or ImplementationTeams that arise from an initial Working Group and/or the issues raisedby an applications oriented Thread are the input to the EOC priority settingactivity. Projects should be outcome oriented and will be evaluated fortheir closeness to the objectives of the EOC, their financial viabilityand contribution to the collaborative model (including collocation of staff)on which the EOC is being built. The Science Review Panel and the COSSASteering Committee will be involved in priority setting with the COSSA SteeringCommittee helping to provide overall directions and the Science Review Panelproviding and monitoring scientific and client goals and input. Science Projects and Implementation Teams will be formed according to specificguide-lines and will be monitored for progress within the EOC structurediscussed below and evaluated against criteria defined at the outset ofthe activity. The outcomes of an EOC Task will emphasise quality of productand excellence of production. A primary role of and criterion for EOC activitiesincludes making the findings accessible and useful to areas of CSIRO andindustry not currently exploiting Earth Observation to its fullest extent. 2.7 Scientific Development The key area of EOC activity relates to the longer term development of andpromotion of excellence in the Earth Observation research base in Australiawhich is fundamental to Australia 'taking charge' of this area and owningits innovation. This can be helped considerably by developing the EarthObservation Industry with consequent creation of demand for graduates anda flow of investment funding into the education system. The EOC will also encourage the professional development of scientists inCSIRO and other groups by providing an environment for visits, study leave,participation in projects and for the direct involvement of CSIRO staffwith post graduate students at associated Universities as joint supervisorsand assessors. The EOC will provide significant support aimed at encouragingstudents to undertake subjects involving advanced Earth Observation techniquesand environmental physics. Scientists from CSIRO Divisions, Agencies and industry will be able to takeadvantage of the pooled knowledge in the EOC by short to medium term involvementin EOC projects. A fundamental aim of the EOC is to educate and enrich theCSIRO staff who are closely involved at the working interface with clientsas well as providing a career development path in fundamental contributionsto Earth Observation Science of a type that is difficult at the client interface.

ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES (continued) 2.8 Structure The EOC structure within COSSA has the nature of a Program in a Division.It has a Science Program Leader, support for the Program Leader and a rangeof activities, or tasks that are the Working Groups, Science Projects and/orImplementation Teams defined above. Fundamental to its operation is thepeer review and advice its Science Panel will provide. The Tasks will be defined and managed to have a beginning, middle and endwith defined goals and measures of satisfactory completion in an appropriatetime frame and (where appropriate) against the benefits to the applicationsoriented Threads. The definition of these measures in the case of strategicresearch will be carefully considered to take into account the open endedand risky nature of such activity and in the case of data management theneed for continuity. The seven main areas for administration and management of EOC activitiesare illustrated in the following chart: The research Tasks are grouped and monitored within four primary 'Focus'areas for generic Earth Observation Science within which issues such asthe following may be researched: Application Support Focus Tools and Methods for: Global change Forestry & forests applications Ocean, coastal & inland waters Crops, pastures & soils Geology & minerals Measurement Models Focus Calibration & validation Geomatic measurement Atmospheric modelling & characterisation Earth surface targets models Field & laboratory procedures Data Systems Focus Archive & Access methodology Common processing software Data integration methods Measurement libraries Data security Sensor Systems Focus Imaging spectrometer support Space & airborne instruments Field instrumentation Space engineering interface These, together with three more general areas of Program Support, National and International Scientific Interaction and Application Oriented Thread Coordination comprise seven areas which provide a more aggregated and persisting basisfor project and financial planning and management. The overall coordination of the Tasks and their interface with the applicationsoriented Threads will be the job of the Science Program Leader. It willtake account of the major Threads that lead to the development of the Tasksand whose end products represent the interests of Applications OrientedDivisional and other clients as well as the specific scientific focus withinwhich the Tasks are carried out. The tasks in the Focus Areas will be developed from Threads of activitythat are involved in Earth Observation products and will be approved accordingto a well defined and explicit priority setting process. The greatest investmentof EOC base funds will generally be to the Science Projects of each areawith Working Groups only needing adequate support for travel, accommodationand reporting and Implementation Teams expected to have highest client support. The specific functions of the areas are: 1. Program Support - Office management, records, information technologyand support services for the Program as well as client reporting and taskcoordination to meet the needs of the Threads; 2. National and International Science Interaction - Area cooperatingwith COSSA role which supports specific scientific input and involvementby EOC scientists in these aspects; 3. Applications Oriented Thread Coordination - Area involved in seekingexternal views on the relationships between the focus markets and the technicalTasks and ensuring that these are served by Task coordination. 4. Application Support Focus - Deals with remote sensing sciencesupport of the applications being addressed by Divisions and EOC contributinggroups. This Focus works at the end of the Threads nearest the end useror Divisional client; 5. Measurement Models Focus - Deals with information and standardproduct derivation, calibration and validation from Earth Observation data.Includes issues of atmospheric correction, land, water and atmospheric modellingand measuremnts as well as advanced product definition; 6. Data Systems Focus - Deals with the generic science issues ofdata access, management and communication and the software base for theproduction of products and research infrastructure. Also provides accessfor Divisions and contributing groups to data not available from other suppliers. 7. Sensor Systems Focus - Deals with the development and specificationof sensor systems, instrumentation for Earth Observation and supportingsite measurements and provides an interface with the Sensor Systems industry. To provide accounting and management, a scientist will be responsible foreach of these areas. This EOC staff member is charged with reporting activityand maintaining a watch on progress against goals and accounts but willnot have line management responsibility for staff or tasks in the focusareas. Task leaders will provide leadership and have primary responsibilityfor the task activities and (with respect to EOC tasks) be responsible tothe Science Program Leader of the EOC.

EOC SCIENCE PROJECTS PLAN The EOC Science Plan has been based on the recommendations of the SimpsonReport (Simpson et al., 1995), the Draft Science Plan DiscussionDocument (Graetz et al., 1995), and a document supporting the appointmentof the Science Program Leader (Jupp, 1995). These have lead to the formulationof the EOC Strategic Science Plan. The Science Projects Plan has also beenbased on the document supporting the common software initiative (Prata,1996) and incorporates ideas presented in a document presented at the AVHRRWorking Group at the 8th Australasian Remote Sensing Conference on the implementationof standards (Jupp, 1996b, McVicar, 1996). All of these documents may beaccessed at the EOC WWW site (http://www.eoc.csiro.au). Some EOC Tasks exist already and others have already progressed throughthe Working Group phase and are initial Tasks for the EOC to address. Themost pressing of these is in the area of AVHRR processing which can be classedas forming an Implementation Team to resolve the problem of there beingno accepted CSIRO standard of processing. It is therefore proposed thata primary initial new EOC task be defined to address the AVHRR processingissue and that proposals for Working Groups be invited to develop the projectportfolio for the EOC. The AVHRR area has already been examined by a WorkingGroup (Prata et al., 1996) and its recommendations form a basis forthe steps outlined below. 4.1 Existing Projects The existing projects and special budget items are: 1. Global change 2. Global 1km data archive 3. Support for international project & working group activities 4. Support for TERSS & WASTAC 5. Data acquisition & Networks 6. Information Products 7. Information Management Systems 8. CIGSN 9. GMS Pathfinder 10. EOC Calibration and Spectral Laboratory Development 11. Various small applications projects CIGSN will be invited to merge with the new developments in CalVal, GMSPathfinder will merge with the generic studies and CalVal and the smallapplications will be invited to refine their activities in the light ofEOC objectives and activities. The area of Data Acquisition and Networks will be reviewed after an EOC/DITWorking Group has examined possible utilisation of the DHPC CRC data network.The Information Management Systems may be reviewed after the CEOS Plenary. Funds will continue to support attendance at PI/AO or other scientific meetings,CEOS & MODIS Working Groups, support an EOC Fellow and provide contributionsto various data collection enterprises. 4.2 AVHRR Processing Implementation As a result of recommendations by the COSSA Steering Committee, the operationsin AVHRR data acquisition and processing at Aspendale and Hobart have beenassessed to increase effectiveness and maximise the benefits of the workthat has been done at the two sites for the benefit of the respective Divisionsand CSIRO. As initial steps in this process, it was decided to phase out data acquisitionat Aspendale and data are now supplied from the facility at Hobart. Datafrom Hobart, Townsville, Darwin, Manila and Casey are also being suppliedto and archived through the Global One-kilometre data project in Canberra.However, it is clear that the process has further to go and must involvea development of a common base of software (Prata, 1996) and the definitionand incorporation of best practice algorithms. This will provide a provingground for CSIRO's approach to the data archiving and dissemination it needsand to the development of a strong and complementary relationship betweenCSIRO research and the operational data management activities of the Bureauof Meteorology. As an initial project focus that builds on the established base of the COSSA/MDP19/EOCprogression and to meet the urgent user driven need to develop consistentand high quality standards in AVHRR processing it is proposed to: 1. Decide on the operation of the Hobart AVHRR receiving facility,including possible EOC management and relationship with Aspendale. Reviewcost structures and establish a cost effective source for raw data untilit can be provided by a Bureau of Meteorology based data supply which issuitable for CSIRO researchers. 2. With the Bureau of Meteorology and other data users and suppliers, implementand support the established new common data format. This has been establishedby cooperation between CSIRO and BoM. 3. Establish a focused Science Team to specify in detail actions will supportthe short and long term common software and software engineering and developmentalenvironment (CAPS) which has been proposed in the AVHRR Working Group (Prata,1996). The result will be an ATBD including algorithms specified in an industrystandard Algorithm Description Language. 4. Establish and demonstrate a base processing capability which consistentlyand measurably achieves 1km Root Mean Square (RMS) navigation errors and5% RMS calibration error levels. This will form the standard Base Productwhich has been developed as one which (if consistently produced to a certifiablestandard) will satisfy a major class of end users. 5. Actively promote the standards set with other data suppliers. In particular,AIMS, BoM and WASTAC. The achievement of these standards may not be by useof CSIRO common software although this is a desirable option. 6. Establish and demonstrate the best CSIRO recommended options for cloudmasking and removal of cloud and cloud shadow contaminated pixels. Establishand demonstrate the options available for NDVI image generation. Activelypromote these with other data suppliers. 7. Establish the CSIRO recommended advanced algorithms, publish them inan ATBD in the Algorithm Description Language and implement selected productsin the CAPS system. 8. Interact closely with AVHRR product suppliers, standards organisationsand end users to define the best and most practical validation procedurescurrently available for AVHRR products. 9. Establish the set of measurable standards for base and advanced processingand establish the sites and tools to demonstrate the benefits of followingwell defined standards to Australian and other users. 10. Develop the One-kilometer data set as an Australian continent and ExtendedEconomic Zone (EEZ) wide base data set to the established consistent basestandard in the new format. Promote the eventual operation and managementof the facility as an Agency responsibility provided the time series remainsaccessible to CSIRO researchers. Activities 4, 6, 7 and 10 will be developed in the Canberra EOC Headquarterswith collocated staff from Hobart, Aspendale and Canberra. Activity 9 willbe done in conjunction with the EOC calibration & validation activity.The common software base for product development will be available to theparticipating groups for future work in AVHRR applications meeting the clientneeds of the Divisions and the make-up of the advanced algorithm set willbe defined with close cooperation and participation of CSIRO Divisions andother contributing groups. The lack of a consistent base standard in Australia is a national problemthat CSIRO can show leadership to resolve. It will provide an underpinningbase for the advanced CSIRO products and the advanced end user orientedproduct development that will meet the needs of CSIRO Sector clients. The plan for this activity is to satisfy the immediate needs by settinga small group to work within an adequate but short timeframe to completeand demonstrate the base processing software standards within the firstyear of full EOC operation (1996/97). The goals can be achieved with a criticalmass of scientists and support staff that currently exist at the EOC andin Divisions and are engaged at least partially in this activity. The advancedalgorithms will be implemented in the second year. At present as describedin the Simpson Report (Simpson et al., 1995), AVHRR processing activityis variable, research fragmented and the products not fully effective. Thisis especially the case with software where the existence and operation ofwidely varying software suites (sometimes evolving from the same initialbase) has created many problems.

EOC SCIENCE PROJECTS PLAN (continued) 4.3 Initial EOC Working Groups As described in Section 3, the development of future EOC projects will startwith Working Groups. At present there are a number of options and workinggroup areas that will provide initial planning documents for the EOC. Theseare ones that have already been discussed and developed within the contextof the previous priority setting criteria and have had some activity underprevious arrangements but are in need of re-defining and re-scoping: 4.3.1 Generic Processing Algorithms The current best practice in atmospheric correction and physical scene modellingneeds to be made available to the user community. The EOC also has a responsibilityto develop innovative ways to remotely sense the properties the Earth. ThisWorking Group will establish the foundation areas for analysis of data fromfuture satellites to which Australian scientists can best contribute, aswell as specifiy the currently best methods by which Divisions can monitorimportant environmental variables. The working group on generic algorithms will specifically examine two mainissues of scene physics: (1) The results of processing needed in many applications are surface reflectancesand temperatures, but their derivation from satellite radiances cannot beeffected without assumptions concerning aerosols (including sub-visual cloud),atmospheric composition (including water vapour and ozone), and the temperatureprofile of the atmosphere. The Working Group will examine the sensitivityof the end-products to each of these factors in order to determine the accuracywith which each must be known to guarantee specified accuracies in the end-products.Using this information, a Science Project addressing generic retrieval algorithmswill be developed and recommended for a selected set of platform/sensorcombinations including GMS and AVHRR. (2) Atmospheric correction, time series image analysis, image mosaickingand earth surface interpretation in Visible/NIR, SWIR and Thermal regionsare all affected by the varying scene radiance known as the BidirectionalReflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). The Working Group will identifyareas where the EOC activity can contribute to the advanced products neededby Australian value added suppliers and to the international work in thissubject. The Projects arising from these WGs will address generic issues and encompassproposed interactions with the processing Threads that will develop forJapanese, US and ESA satellites and sensors (eg GMS, ASTER, MODIS, ADEOS,AVHRR and others), potential Australian developments (ARIES) as well asairborne and near surface measurements. 4.3.2 Calibration & Validation It is essential that the EOC translate theoretical analyses into qualitycontrolled and validated products. Therefore, a Working Group will examinethe establishment and long-term maintenance of sites for vicarious calibrationof visible and near infrared sensors, as well as validation of derived productssuch as aerosol optical thickness and land surface termperature. The activitiesidentified will build on the existing investment in the CIGSN sites forAVHRR and AATSR thermal calibration and validation. In particular, AVHRRand GMS calibration in visible and AVHRR, AATSR and ADEOS in the thermalregions. The current CIGSN and Bureau of Meteorology sites will be reviewedfor their suitability and their data records and experience used to thefullest extent in the projects developed. The GMS Pathfinder project is a specific 'Thread' in the calibration work.It is a joint initiative of BoM, CSIRO, AIMS and SCRIPPS, the latter throughNASA sponsorship. The first objective is to produce a base level data setcovering the benchmark period July 1994 to December 1995, using best availablemethods for geo-location and radiometric calibration. Following this, higherlevel data products will be generated. The Working Group on Vicarious Calibrationwill also address calibration of the GMS visible channel. This will involveselection of high reflectivity, uniform and stable targets, instrumentedto measure spectral reflectance of the surface and loadings of aerosolsand water vapour. The instrumentation must also allow recovery of the aerosolphase function so that top of atmosphere radiance calculations may be made. Vicarious calibration activities underpin work relating to all platformsand sensors and provide the sites to test and validate models as well asundertake scaling and data fusion studies. The WG will provide the basicdiscussion of the role of sites in permanent data collection as well ascalibration missions. Its recommendations will also extend to field measurementmethods and ancillary data requirements as well as the basic assets neededfor an EOC equipment 'library'. 4.3.3 Scene Brightness Modelling and Correction The issue of scene brightness is one stretching across scales and involvinginvestigations ranging from pragmatic, through statistical to advanced modelbased answers to the problems facing users in: Constructing mosaics from video, scanner and satellite data Comparing data in time series for real change in surface conditions Developing products based on BRDF and scene variance CSIRO scientists have the capacity to develop solutions to these problemsranging from empirical to those based on atmospheric and scene physics.This WG will outline the significant applications issues of scene brightnessand recommend a set of projects to achieve solutions satisfactory to currentuser needs. The brightness variations due to surface BRDF and atmospheric effects areat the heart of progress that can be made for land surface targets. Atmosphericcorrection and land spectral data interpretation all need information onthese effects which can be developed by modelling and field data campaigns. A Meeting held as part of ARSC8 involving industry (Frank Honey) and internationalgroups (Alan Stahler/MODIS) has nominated Norm Campbell (CSIRO DMS) andElizabeth McDonald (ERIN) to coordinate interest with a small committeeand set parameters for this Working Group. Some of the theoretical optionshave been summarised in Jupp and Strahler (1996). The WG may develop a proposalfor a Science Project involving a combination of empirical and scene physicsbased studies and their testing on a well specified common base of data.There is also scope for a thorough study of field instrumentation and proceduresthat will complement EO data to allow the scene brightness effects to bewell handled. An outline of the supporting data for the test data sets mayalso lead to documentation of wide use in field mission planning. 4.4 General Working Group Development The actual mass centres of generic activity in CSIRO and the needs of CSIROand other researchers and Earth Observation data users for greatest collaborationand support may not be well represented by the initial Projects. The initialprojects reflect the past activities, the immediate obligations to addressthe Simpson Report and the level of readiness of some proposals comparedwith others. There is therefore to be a call for CSIRO scientists to suggest, attendand support Working Groups (WGs) for EOC projects. Funds are being set asidefor travel and support for scientists to meet and provide material for theresulting documents. The WGs will be reported in accordance with WG guidelinesand discussed by the Science Advisory Committee and EOC management. The proposals generated by this activity will be developed in accordancewith well defined guidelines and ranked against CSIRO, Divisional and EOCpriorities. Areas that could be investigated include ground site and field mission instrumentation and procedures (includingthe scope for an EOC equipment 'library'); thermal region remote sensing at a number of scales; Australian satellite sensor mission support (atmospheric correction,sensor specification, Cal/Val, Spectral Libraries and advanced algorithms); optical water quality and ocean colour; as well as radar and microwave developments. Provided there is satisfactory agreement among contributing groups, valuein the cooperative, outcome oriented model as opposed to a single Divisionalactivity, a demonstrated CSIRO niche and capability and sufficient staffand financial resources, the projects with highest priority will becomemajor EOC activities. In keeping with the EOC distributed Project concept,the location of the team and its Task leader will depend on all issues ofefficiency of outcome and can be at any adquately resourced location. Working Groups will generally be one of two types. One type is a genericstudies WG where the EOC Task is already specified and the job is to ouitlineits scope and impacts. The second is the Thread based WG where a productor a general area of EO data analysis is discussed. For example, ThreadWGs may be for a satellite and sensor combination like ASTER, MODIS or GMSPathfinder or be for an application such as optical water quality. Out ofThread WGs will come recommendations for one or more Science Projects and/orone or more Implementation Teams to focus on generic Tasks that supportthe Thread activity. Thread oriented WGs are obviously more client focussedas well. Thread WGs will often involve the same people in a number of contexts.However, the principle of Working Groups is to define the Tasks to minimiseduplication and maximise the effectiveness of the generic Tasks. MaximumThreads and minimum Tasks is the desired result.

EARTH OBSERVATION IN CSIRO CSIRO supports a significant effort in Earth Observation science (whichis basically the study and utilisation of data from instruments on remoteplatforms - including aircraft and satellites) and its integration withother data and models. Australia has a high international reputation for excellence and innovationin this area and within Australia CSIRO has been a leader in creating thatsituation. Earth Observation and remote sensing are generic technologies which crossSector and Divisional boundaries. They are also firmly engaged in the taskof meeting the objectives of the Sectors and Divisions that currently utilisethem. This mixed generic and applications oriented nature has sometimes lead toduplication and fragmentation of effort as groups with different end usercommunities tackle the same generic issues. This, despite the excellenceof individual contributions, can lead to overall under-achievement comparedwith what is possible. Such fragmentation can only be overcome by increasedcoordination and focus across Sector and Divisional boundaries. Despite such problems, it is clear from the presentations at the SectorOutlook that Earth Observation and remote sensing are prominent in the plansof a number of Sectors to meet the challenges of the future. This role isespecially clear in the growing needs for tools to measure, monitor andevaluate environmental management systems The future opportunities and focusareas for Earth Observation in the main Sectors which have included thistechnology in their mapping and presentations are: Biodiversity Advanced tools for environmental measurement ,monitoring and assessmentat many scales is a common theme which this Sector shares. Underpinningthis opportunity is the need for consistent data and standards of base processingas well as operational tools for data analysis and integration with othertechnologies, such as GIS. Many of the opportunities here will depend ongeneric development of base information streams and the needs are sharedwith other Sectors. It would be inefficient for these generic tasks to bepursued in each Sector in isolation. Land & Water Here, the opportunities and needs are clearly similar to those of Biodiversityexcept that there are some special opportunities in large area assessment,catchment management, water quality assessment and monitoring and soil moistureand water balance studies. These tools are the basis for successful rapidand large area monitoring capability. Again, there is a move throughoutthe world to consolidate the 'pioneering' research of recent years and developobjective standards and means to evaluate information quality. These standardswill need to use the skill base that is partly within the Sector but mostlyassociated with other Sectors - such as Climate and Atmosphere and Marine. Climate & Atmosphere The level of use of remote sensing and satellite borne measurementsin the Climate and Atmosphere Sector is very high. It is also set to growsubstantially as processed data streams enter the base of traditional meteorologicaldata with established standards and specific target measurements. The needto establish processing technologies that exploit the physical basis forremote sensing measurements underpins the successful incorporation of thedata streams into climate models and leads to a large proportion (possibly60-70%) of the work being generic. The fact that these same generic technologiesare the ones that provide the consistent and standardised data streams neededin other Sectors such as Marine, Land & Water, Biodiversity and evenMineral Exploration & Mining should be carefully considered. Marine There is considerable excitement in the Sector Outlook presentation whenit refers to the opportunities current and future streams of Earth Observationdata and associated instrumentation will provide for research and industryin the Marine Sector. The scale of ocean and coastal processes can onlybe consistently encompassed from remote platforms and the development ofnew sensors and processing methodologies has provided information that makesocean surfaces, currents, productivity and the interactions of oceans withother climate processes to be measured. Again, possibly 60-70% of the taskis generic and shared by the Climate and Atmosphere Sector, Land and WaterSector, Biodiversity and the Mineral Exploration and Mining Sectors as theyutilise this technology. Mineral Exploration & Mining In many ways, there is more maturity in the use of Earth Observation technologyin this Sector as mirrored in the way it is mentioned only in conjunctionwith other instrumental and data processing technologies in the Sector OutlookForum papers. However, here there are emerging uses of new instruments withvery high spectral resolution and high sensitivity. Significantly, muchof the processing technology and methodology associated with estimatingsurface mineralogy and abundances from remote sensing involves the samefundamental physical science issues as are needed for exploiting high spectralinformation in marine, coastal and inland waters or in searching for biologicalresources. Other Sectors that might evaluate their utilisation of this technology are: Forestry & Forest Products The needs here are similar to Biodiversity and there is currently closecollaboration between Divisions involved in these Sectors. Additional opportunitiescome from the growth in high spatial and spectral resolution airborne technologiesand the convergence of traditional surveying and forest survey based onaerial photography with digital 'geomatics' based processing and automated'photo'-interpretation. Service Sector & Information Technology & Telecom Sector Both of these Sectors are addressing the issues of data streams, communication,pipeline processing and data 'mining'. These are primary technologies beingput to work in the standardisation of Earth Observation data. However, thespecial needs of the processing technologies - being based on the physicsof environmental processes and instrument engineering makes them 'lessons'for generic data processing that need to be learned. The following document supports these observations and outlines the waythe recently formed Earth Observation Centre (EOC) within COSSA is developingTasks that strengthen the strategic directions of Earth Observation andovercomes the underlying impediments to success that have been present inrecent years. It is also proposed that the market for information basedon remotely sensed data products relevant to Australia and the Asia-Pacificregion will grow slowly, or at least the Australian share of the marketwill grow slowly (or not at all) unless we move to ensure product qualityand standards. These standards can be productively and practically basedon the best science and achieve high quality. The groups that attain consistentlyhigh quality and reliable information from these sources will win marketsin environmental monitoring and resource mapping that are already growingstrongly throughout the Asia-Pacific region. The means for CSIRO to address these questions is by consolidating our somewhatdispersed activities and focussing and coordinating the generic activitiesbetween Sectors whilst maintaining a strong capacity to address end userneeds and the needs of the suppliers of data and consultancies to end userswithin Sectors. The Applications Oriented focus of groups directly addressingSector issues can be best enhanced by developing strong interactions withthe industry that will eventually deliver the quality products. The underpinninggeneric developments can be best accomplished by coordinating and utilisingthe existing skill base. 2. THE EARTH OBSERVATION (EO) MARKET The EO Market in Australia in the past has been characterised by heavy governmentinvestment and difficulties for the development of a true private industrylocally and in the Asia Pacific region. Such characteristics are not atypical of the type of Market it has been- an emerging market in a 'pioneering' stage. In the more mature areas ofEO and in many parts of the world, an Earth Observation industry is developingwhich is moving from emergence to growth as characterised in the followingTable: This Table reflects the experience of Earth Observation and remote sensingvery well. The only point I think it does not emphasise enough is that inthe initial emerging phase there is often a lot of 'speculative' investment.This is often by government. In a sense, there is easy money that encouragesgrowth of many small groups. In the growth phase the investment becomesless speculative, groups need to consolidate and standards of product qualityare required. I believe this is happening in Earth Observation and we mustrespond accordingly. If the growth phase is reached, it provides many opportunities. The mainopportunities for CSIRO to promote and share in this growth in our regionand to see Australian companies share in the growth are to develop standards,quality, best practice from its wide experience and world recognised researchin past years. CSIRO can see these advanced methods transfer into the handsof the market developers and the other (industrial) research groups whoprovide the tools for the end users in the different Sectors. The main current problem for the early developers seems to be the reticenceof end users in the face of the prevalent 'pioneering' style of productsand the lack of objective standards. It is clear, however, that such standardscan emerge and the industry move from endless meetings of bureaucrats toan active market of identified users and competent suppliers. CSIRO mustplay an active role in this transition if Australia is to provide its shareof competent suppliers. 3. SECTOR ACTIVITY The level of investment in Earth Observation and Remote Sensing in CSIROis high and spreads across many Divisions and Sectors. However, in any oneSector, this activity is generally merged into the "Chunks" andattached to the end purpose of the use of the technology. Identifying theactivity with its end use is not a problem, but low visibility is. It isalso hard to extract a total figure. Some indication of the investment by Division is provided by the followingtable giving numbers of people currently reached in the EOC mailing andreferred to as the Earth_Observing_Crew: The COSSA Sector Mapping for the Sector Stocktake identified six Sectorswhere support from COSSA as well as direct COSSA/EOC and Aircraft activitycould be mapped. These are: Biodiversity Climate & Atmosphere Information Technology & Telecommunications Land & Water Marine Mineral Exploration & Mining The COSSA/EOC activity by Sector as defined for the Sector Stocktake ispresented in the following Table. It includes both a science component andactivity COSSA has pursued on behalf of the science activity in the formof National and International liaison, management of missions, instrumentationprojects and communication. It mirrors the spread of scientists in the EarthObserving Crew and is a level of underpinning investment that has produceda level of high achievement in this area of CSIRO activity: This Table shows how COSSA (and the previous MDP19) invested in CSIRO EarthObservation in a way that mirrored the centres of activity in CSIRO. Mineralshas greatest attention followed by Climate and Atmosphere, Marine and thenLand and Water and Biodiversity. This investment over the past 10 yearshas supported the excellence that CSIRO and Australia are known for internationally. 4. SECTOR FORUM The Sector Forum showed that remote sensing technology is seen as akey element in a number of Sectors. The following excerpts are from theOutlook Forum papers and show in what context the EO and remote sensingactivities were listed: 4.1 MINERAL EXPLORATION AND MINING SECTOR "3. CSIRO and the Sector 3.2 CSIRO's Capabilities CSIRO's core capabilities in support of the Sector's activitiesencompass a range of disciplines and competencies including structural geology,petrology, geochemistry, airborne and borehole geophysics, remote sensing,computer modelling, mine planning, engineering, geomechanics, environmentalscience and engineering. The Organisation's competitive advantage lies inits ability to bring together multidisciplinary teams of sufficient expertiseand critical mass to address issues of national importance in a timely andeffective manner. 3.4 Strategic Directions advanced instrumentation systems for geophysical and geochemicalexploration, mining and environmental engineering. 4. Return to Australia Assessment 4.2 Feasibility With the exception of airborne gravity, airborne geophysicsis a relatively mature and highly competitive market. The combinationof instrumentation on a single airborne or satellite platform is likelyto be the next major advance, with significant potential for developingcommercially valuable intellectual property. Airborne gravity, on the otherhand is one of the last great frontiers in exploration geophysics - characterisedby high risk, significant cost, but potentially high returns." 4.2 MARINE SECTOR "Major Trends in Science and Technology Research and Technological Innovation - advances in computing,field techniques, remote sensing, rapid biodiversity assessment andecosystem modelling. Strategic Research Directions Develop new technologies and techniques targeted at key industriesand government requirements e.g. integrated models of the ecosystem; environmentalbiomarkers; remote sensing; biodiversity assessment; decision supportsystems. R&D Capacity Australia's Marine Sector is world-class in coral reef marinestudies, marine ecology, chemistry and geosciences, physical oceanography,fisheries research, remote sensing applications; coastal hydrodynamics,numerical modelling." 4.3 LAND & WATER SECTOR "2. Sector Outlook 2.3 Opportunities and Major Science and Technology Issues for the Sector New tertiary information technologies (e.g. GIS, remote sensing,simulation modelling, communications) could be developed as integrativetools to tackle large-scale multi-disciplinary problems in land and watermanagement. Major recent Achievements (a selection) New techniques for on-ground and remote sensing of rangelandconditions developed for State agencies are improving assessment efficiency." 4.4 BIODIVERSITY SECTOR "3. CSIRO and the Biodiversity Sector 3.2 CSIRO's capabilities CSIRO's size and the breadth of its disciplinary span providean in-house biodiversity research capacity unequalled in Australia. Withapplication to soils, water, plants, animals and microorganisms, disciplinesinclude ecology, genetics, biosystematics, microbiology, virology, biochemistry,molecular biology, physiology, nutrition, pathology and parasitology. Skillsin GIS, remote sensing, survey design, modelling and expert systemdesign support the research and its application. Our skill base in sociologyand economics is small but expanding. Critical to the application of researchis the capacity to apply these skills in multidisciplinary teams to sectorneeds; these teams also draw on skills from other CSIRO sectors, particularlyLand and Water. Important facilities include those for plant and diseasequarantine, including high biocontainment at AAHL, and the National BiologicalCollections." 4.5 CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERE SECTOR "2. Sector Outlook Science and Technology Trends: There will be increased use of communication and informationtechnology (including supercomputing) and of remote sensing technology.The already strong emphasis on international collaboration and exchangeof information and technology will increase. There will be a continued increasein the integration of disciplinary science and increased focus on researchapplications. Developments in technology will enable a wide range of observations(dynamical, analytical, microphysical, biological; both in situ orby remote sensing) to be made with unprecedented resolution, precisionand coverage. 3. CSIRO and the Sector CSIRO Capabilities Scientific expertise and access to a wide range of facilities,e.g. RV Franklin, RV Australis, GASLAB, ICELAB, Phytotron,Airtrak and analytical chemistry facilities, LADM, DARLAM, SCAM, and otherlocal and regional models, TERSS and other remote sensing receptionand processing facilities, advanced instruments for surface boundary-layerand cloud physics research, the CSIRO Climate Model, stratospheric chemicalmodel, advanced decision-support systems for management of rangelands, agriculturalproduction and rural fires. Strategic Directions A strong strategic research effort in atmospheric composition,climate processes and climate modelling will be necessary to provide outcomeson climate change adaptation and mitigation. There will be new contributionsto development and applications of remote sensing technology in bothstrategic studies of the natural system and for natural resource management. 4. Return to Australia Assessment Attractiveness (2) Australia's Ability to Capture There is strong demand for the types of applications in airpollution, climate change, climate variability and remote sensing researchthat the Sector produces. Already the results are widely used and acceptedby government and industry. Public acceptance is very high and projectedto remain high. Prospects for future adoption of climate and atmosphereresearch outcomes are excellent. Feasibility (3) R&D Potential Scientific understanding in the Sector is well established andis poised for rapid progress through the opportunities available from newanalytical, remote sensing, computing and information technology,from the integration of disciplinary expertise and from increasing internationalcollaboration. There is a need to resolve underlying scientific uncertaintiesin order to advance the science, its interpretation and its application.Rapid and dramatic change in communication technology is expected to significantlyincrease the opportunity to reach new users of research outcomes, particularlythrough decision-support systems." This set of direct quotations indicates the pervasive view in these applicationsoriented Sectors of the fundamental role of Earth Observation and RemoteSensing to meeting their objectives. Perhaps the most obvious omissionswere the strong activity and opportunity for remote sensing of water qualitythrough optical models in the Water and Land Sector and the opportunitiesfor Radar and microwave remote sensing in a number of Sectors. There wasalso no mention of the opportunities recent developments of geographic data(such as digital elevation data) create through synergy with Earth Observationdata. It is clear, however, in all cases that physical measurements fromremote platforms (including aircraft and satellites) provide a primary setof tools for future regional environmental monitoring and resource assessment. 5. THE CSIRO EARTH OBSERVATION CENTRE The Simpson review of CSIRO Earth Observation infrastructure and activities(Simpson et al., 1994 ) led to the formation of the of the CSIROEarth Observation Centre (EOC) as a science program in COSSA. The EOC hasbeen established to provide focus and leadership in Earth Observation sciencefor Australia and promote a coordinated and collaborative approach to genericresearch and interactions in Earth Observation from satellites and aircraftplatforms in CSIRO. At the time of the Report, CSIRO Earth Observation wasachieving less than it could from problems of generic fragmentation andunproductive duplication of effort. A new model was needed. The EOC has been established to pursue the generic Earth Observation sciencethat underpins the activities across many Divisions and Sectors throughcoordination rather than by creating yet another competing group. It issetting as its goal the exploitation of the high impact that physical sciencescan make on the Earth Observation market in this developed phase of itsgrowth and it uses a collaborative model in which the work is done by theexisting, in-place capacity in CSIRO. The Collaborative model defines outcome oriented projects, uses the bestteams from the applications (ie Sector) oriented Divisions as well as anEOC 'core' group. By utilising existing structures rather than setting upnew ones the resources can be used efficiently and the benefits spread easilyback to the participating Divisions and their customers in their Sectors. The EOC Science Program has established its Science Plan and initial collaborativeTasks based on this model. It has Focus areas in Applications Support, MeasurementModels, Data Systems and Sensor Systems. Information about the EOC can befound on the WWW at: http://www.eoc.csiro.au/eoc/eoc.htm A primary problem facing CSIRO success in Earth Observation in everySector is, however. still generic fragmentation. As a result of it, in thewords of the Simpson Report, "a given group's work attempts to coverinstrumentation development, ground station operations, algorithm development,applications development, validation and product delivery. This task istoo big for small, geographically isolated groups." It was these attemptsin the past, within competing Divisional structures, that promoted the genericfragmentation. Local beliefs in unique excellence were often simply duplicationof equally good activities at other sites. In the end, no-one was achievingwhat they might through greater communication and collaboration. The EOC, as a science program in COSSA is seeking to map its collaborativeTasks onto the Sectors in which the results create significant impact. Ultimately,the main impact will be in the markets the Sectors support and it is thisimpact that must feed back to justify the generic research. EOC Tasks areaimed to bring the best teams of scientists together to tackle problemsthat cross Divisional and Sector boundaries. In so doing, they impact onthe end users and markets in all of the relevant Sectors and create efficiencyof effort in achieving the impact. In a time of focus and consolidationin the Earth Observation industry, we cannot afford to do less. 6. EOC TASKS The EOC is working with the Divisions involved to present a set of coordinatedand generic Tasks to the Sector process. By their nature, these Tasks willbe spread between Sectors and involve a number of Divisions. That is, theyneed to be supported and resourced jointly by more than one Sector and allocatethe pooled support to more than one location. This is obviously not an easyprocess. However, the efficiency and benefits of recognising and resourcingthe wide impact of coordinated underpinning Tasks in this area are clearfrom the Sector Outlook Forum papers. Among the generic Tasks being undertaken through the EOC are some whichunderpin all of the Sectors above and some which may be in only a few -or even one. However, they all benefit from the collaborative focus of peopleand groups from different Divisions and with often diverse applicationsand disciplines. The Tasks are truly cross Divisional and cross Sectoraland underpin Earth Observation in all of these as well as their target industriesand markets. The initial Tasks being commenced this year through the EOC will involvecontributions from Divisions through the involvement of the existing CSIRObase of Earth Observation skill and capacity as well as the EOC and (whereappropriate) outside contributors and are as follows: Primary Thread: Earth Observation Data Consistency & Standardisation. Generic Task Areas: 1. Instrumentation The EOC is developing an information system to CSIRO capacity in field instrumentationas well a common pool. 2. Calibration Sites Current and some new calibration sites based on land and marine targetsare being developed collaboratively and used to establish base consistencyfor AVHRR, GMS and Landsat satellite data. 3. Scene Brightness The issue of scene modelling and physics impacts on all scales of data andis being addressed both empirically and from a scene physics base. 4. Algorithms and Processing A common set of software tools and best selections of algorithms for processingis being established and promoted among CSIRO and collaborating groups. 5. Validation Missions Selected missions that validate algorithms, calibrations and products arebeing promoted and coordinated to establish protocols and tools for theassessment and maintenance of product quality. 6. Data management & Communication Base tools and demonstrations of data management and communication are beingcoordinated with the other Tasks. The selected data streams are the meansof evaluating this technology for CSIRO benefit. 7. Product presentation, Quality & Standards For selected data streams of AVHRR, GMS and Landsat (in the short term)provide the demonstrations of product quality that results from coordinatedgeneric processing Tasks and the collaboration of CSIRO best teams. In addition to these Task there are also some Working Groups planned. Theseare providing the assessments needed the development of future Tasks. EOC Working Groups: Hyperspectral, Energy & Water Balances & Fluxes,Optical Water Quality, Unmixing; Radar applications These Tasks and Working Groups address needs of the growing market as wellas the research needs of CSIRO Divisions. They represent areas of activitywhich, if pursued individually by Divisional groups in the current climateof careful investment and limited resources will produce lower overall impactthan could be attained from the full base of excellence and research focusthat CSIRO can collectively provide. They must, however, be resourced inthe future through mapping into more than one Sector and on the basis ofsupport and promotion by (often) many Divisions. Some mechanism is neededto make this feasible and attractive. EOC Tasks represent a form of generic underpinning and collaboration thatmay seem to challenge the Sector structure but which must ultimately bepromoted by the Sector process if the clear efficiencies are to be captured.Earth Observation and remote sensing are not the only generic technologiesin this position but they are a clearly defined example of the benefit ofsupporting areas across the Sector and Divisional boundaries.

INTRODUCTION EOC Tasks are, as described in the EOC Science Plan (COSSA, 1996), of threekinds. The first is the Working Group which is a 'committee' typeof activity with a specific time-frame that investigates feasibility anddevelops or specifies one or both of the other types as outcomes. The resultsare the Science Project and the Implementation Team. The firstis developed to tackle generic research oriented issues and the second toimplement defined products - such as software or an ATBD for existing algorithms. EOC Tasks form modular components of one or more broader areas of nationaland international interest and activity such as those pursued in CSIRO Sectors.These are called 'Threads'. Theads are generally linked chains of dependentactivities ending in specifically focussed products for, or contributionsto, more complex Earth Observation projects. Coordinating the relationship between the EOC Tasks that tackle genericcontributions to (often many) Threads and the wider objectives of the Threadswill be a 'task' for EOC management. Threads are the end-to-end pathways of Earth Observation activity that resultin delivery of results in the applications oriented CSIRO Sectors. For example,monitoring of ocean processes and biological productivity have remote sensingactivities behind the product as do the wide range of activities being pursuedin a number of CSIRO Sectors as discussed in Jupp (1996b). In addition to such applications oriented Threads, activities that CSIROscientists have been involved with such as GMS Pathfinder, AATSR, ASTERand EOS are also examples of Threads. Others include the CSIRO activityin the USGS 1Km Global AVHRR Archive, interactions with WASTAC, ACRES andTERSS and the (well known) Earth Observation commercialisation activitiesCSIRO has been involved with in the past. In each case there are specificactivities, the involvement of wider groups than CSIRO and often specifictypes of sensor or product. In all cases there are generic activities that can best be tackled by cooperative,outcome oriented Tasks which involve contributions from the EOC, CSIRO Divisionsand the participating groups. These are what we are setting out to identifyand then to tackle with combined skills brought together from the pool ofexcellence in the CSIRO Earth_Observing_Crew. In the initial setting up period, we are faced with the existence of previousprojects and proposals as well as obligations, such as our need to addressand resolve the problems listed in the Simpson Report (Simpson et al.,1995). In addition, a number of significant Threads have emerged from theEOC Meetings. In this case, it has been important to separate the activitiesinto the immediate term and the longer term. In the immediate term, a fewcoordinated Tasks have been defined which will enable the EOC to demonstratethe benefits of the best science on product quality and the benefits ofthe collaborative model in achieving this. In the longer term, the EOC WorkingGroups need to address the processes of the Sector mapping system and definethe Tasks that will contribute to CSIRO sectors (Jupp, 1996b). From the Meetings and wide ranging discussions of the EOC Plan we have defineda general Thread that can be demonstrated in the shorter term. This is:"Earth Observation Data Consistency and Standardisation". Theneed to achieve this in an agreed way is the basis for consistently comparableresearch findings and operationally successful value added products. Thenew Thread cuts a path along and across a number of the Threads listed inJupp (1996c) but its Tasks (as will be described below) go a long way tobenefitting and serving the previously listed Threads as well.

NASA's space shuttle was in routine use for placing satellites inorbit, and retrieving and servicing them, prior to the Challenger accidentin January 1986. Australia's first domestic communications satellite AUSSAT 1 was launchedby space shuttle in August 1985. COSSA Slide 2 ARIANE, THE EUROPEAN LAUNCH VEHICLE ARIANE is a three-stage expendable rocket for launching communications satellitesfinanced by ESA (European Space Agency) and developed by CNES (Centre Nationald'Etude Spatiales, the French national space agency), with system integrationby the French company, Aerospatiale. The production and marketing of ARIANE launchers is now handled by Arianespace,a commercial organization of 36 European companies, 13 banks, and CNES,set up in 1980. ARIANE-1, shown here, is designed to place satellites of up to 970 kg intogeostationary orbit. The vehicle was declared operational in January 1982following three successful test flights out of a program of four. The finalsuccessful test flight on 20 December 1981 (launch shown here) placed theEuropean maritime communications satellite (MARECS-A) into orbit. ARIANE completed many successful launches up until May 1986, when a rocketfailure put the program on hold. Launches were recommenced in September1987, when Aussat 3 was successfully placed into Geostationary TransferOrbit following an Ariane launch from Kourou, in French Guiana. COSSA Slide 3 JAPANESE LAUNCH VEHICLE The sixth N-11 vehicle lifting off from its launch pad at NASDA's (NationalSpace Development Agency of Japan) Osaki Launch Site, Tanegashima SpaceCentre on 3 August 1984. It placed the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite-3(GMS-3), servicing the Asia-Pacific region, into orbit. Australia obtains its satellite weather pictures from GMS, which sits inspace about 36 000 km above Papua New Guinea. COSSA Slide 4 SOME REMOTE SENSING SATELLITES LANDSAT-5 is the latest in a series of U.S. Earth Resources Technology Satellites(ERTS) launched during the 1970s and 1980s by NASA. The LANDSAT satellitesare now operated by NOAA (U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)as land remote sensing satellites. LANDSAT satellites are being progressively'privatize'. The Administration also operates the NOAA polar-orbiting weathersatellites. BAKSHIRA-2 is a remote-sensing satellite launched by the U.S.S.R. in 1981for the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). The next Indian remotesensing satellite, called IRS, was built by ISRO and was launched on anIndian rocket in 1986. SPOT is the French national remote sensing satellite, placed in orbit during1985 by the European launch vehicle ARIANE. It was built by Matra Espace,France and is commercially operated by Spot Image. A significant technologicaladvance carried by SPOT will be the steerable mirror on its scanner, whichthereby allows it to provide more frequent cover of a particular zone asstereoscopic images. Japan's MOS-1 (Marine Observation Satellite) was launched in early 1987. It was built by NEC, a Japanese company, for NASDA (National Space DevelopmentAgency of Japan). MOMS (Marine Observation Meteorological Satellite) was launched by WestGermany in ???? ERS-1 (ERS, Earth Resources Satellite) is the first satellite in the EuropeanSpace Agency's remote sensing program, due for launch aboard ARIANE in 1989. Its prime function will be surveillance of the oceans and coastal zones,including ice monitoring. ERS-1 is being built by the German company, Dornier. It will be the first of the new generation of radar-equipped, remote-sensingsatellites, which can 'see' day or night, through clear or cloudy skies. As well as radar, ERS-1 will carry the Along Track Scanning Radiometer(ATSR), the development of which is a collaborative project between theUK Science and Engineering Council and CSIRO. RADARSAT, the Canadian remote sensing satellite, will carry a radar scannersimilar to that of ERS-1. It is being built by Spar Aerospace and the plannedlaunch date is 1990. COSSA Slide 5 LANDSAT SATELLITES LANDSAT-4, shown here, was launched in 1982. It is one of the series ofEarth Resources Technology Satellites (ERTS) launched by the US. Two arecurrently operational: LANDSAT-4 and LANDSAT-5. Each LANDSAT satellite has a mass of about 1 tonne and orbits the earthfrom north to south (polar orbit) at an altitude of about 706 kilometres. Complete coverage of the globe is provided by each satellite once every16 days. As the satellite passes overhead, the earth is viewed by the multispectralscanning (MSS) telescope. The telescope scans to and fro across a 185 kilometre-widestrip of the earth below, detecting light of four different wavelengthsin green, red, and two infra-red bands. The light intensity in each ofthese four bands is measured for individual 80 metre-square areas. Thereare 7.5 million of these very small picture elements, or pixels (pixel size= 80m2) in one standard 185 kilometre-square LANDSAT image. The ThematicMapper (TM) was flown as a new R & D sensor on LANDSAT-4. It becameoperational (on LANDSAT-5) in August 1984. The pixel size for TM is 30m2. In addition, it covers a much greater spectral range than MSS. The TDRS antenna allows NASA's TDRS (Tracking Data Relay Satellites) toobtain data from LANDSAT without the need for ground stations or on boardrecording. The solar array collects energy to power the satellite. S- and X-band antennae transmit data to earth at 2 different frequencies,S for current MSS and X for new TM.

COSSA Slide 7 HOW LANDSAT SCANS THE EARTH'S SURFACE This diagram gives some of the technical details of LANDSAT's multispectralscanning (MSS) system. COSSA Slide 8 THE ACRES DATA ACQUISITION AND DATA PROCESSING FACILITIES The Australian Centre for Remote Sensing's Data Acquisition and Data ProcessingFacility is located at Alice Springs. It was commissioned in 1979. Theantenna receives LANDSAT data for all parts of Australia and the neighbouringseas. The recording equipment is in the buildings in the background. Thedata received from the satellite are taken to Canberra for processing. The reception facility regularly receives Landsat MSS data, and is beingupgraded to receive and process Landsat TM data, plus data from the FrenchSPOT satellite. COSSA Slide 9 AUSTRALIAN USES FOR LANDSAT DATA, 1983-84 Australians were quick to see the potential value of LANDSAT images to themanagement of this continent's vast resources and wide open spaces. Australianscientists began investigating the use of LANDSAT photographs soon afterthe first LANDSAT was launched in 1972. They were particularly interestedat that time in exploration for minerals. Now, fifteen years later and after much original research on image enhancement,Australians use LANDSAT images for a wide range of purposes, but with geology,geography, and exploration still at the head of the list, with agriculturaland pastoral purposes increasing. COSSA Slides 10 and 11 LANDSAT IMAGES OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF Slide 10 is a raw LANDSAT image of Batt Reef and Tongue Reef on the GreatBarrier Reef between Cairns and Cooktown. The reef appears as pale-bluebeneath the sea surface. The raw data from LANDSAT can be enhanced in various ways. Slide 11 isa 'classified' image of the same view as Slide 10. Classification involvesthe use of a computer algorithm which analyses each pixel (picture element)and groups into classes or sets of pixels having similar spectral values. Each of these classes can then be given a label (interpreted in reef coverterms) by a reef scientist or manager. Groups of pixels having the samelabel can then be aggregated and an image plotted with each class havinga distinct colour. COSSA Slides 12 and 13 HYDROGRAPHERS PASSAGE: LANDSAT SHOWS SAFE SHIPPING WAY A deep-water channel known as Hydrographers Passage , through the GreatBarrier Reef, is shown running top left to bottom right in this LANDSATpicture (Slide 12). Its discovery in 1982 by HMAS 'Flinders' was made possibleby careful studies of aerial and satellite pictures, as well as detailedsurvey work by 'Flinders'. Coal ships travelling from Hay Point to Japanare now using the passage and saving 1600 kilometres per trip and millionsof dollars per year. The LANDSAT scanner is sensitive to various spectral regions or colours,and this permits detection of light from various depths below the sea surface. In the image of Hydrographers Passage given in Slide 13, yellow has beenassigned to the band that penetrates right down to 15 metres. Red is theintermediate band that shows areas from 50 centimetres to 5 metres deep. Very shallow areas, less than 50 centimetres deep, are shown as green. COSSA Slide 14 LANDSAT DETECTS LAND CLEARING AND OTHER LAND USE CHANGES The benefits of using LANDSAT techniques to observe progressive changesin vegetation have been shown in a study of Kangaroo Island by the RemoteSensing Branch of the South Australian Department of Environment and Planning. This slide shows LANDSAT images of the same area of the island on two differentdates in 1983. The dark areas are forest and scrubland, and pale areasare fallow paddocks, red areas are crops and green pasture. Seasonal changesin land use are obvious, but so too is the fact that some considerable landclearance has taken place even over the short period involved. COSSA Slides 15 and 16 MAPPING FLOODS WITH LANDSAT LANDSAT images can be used to map floods and so suggest where levee banksshould be placed and where valuable structures or equipment should not. They have been used in this way by oil and gas explorers in the CooperBasin of South Australia, which is prone to sudden and catastrophic floods,and to map the flood of the Darling River in 1974. These two slides show first the normal flow of the Fitzroy River, WesternAustralia, and second the river in massive flood in March 1983. LANDSATpictures together with information from the NOAA satellite and aerial photographs,were used to trace the movement of the floodwaters. This knowledge of howthe flood developed was used to determine where best to locate levee banksand other flood mitigation measures. COSSA Slides 17 and 18 LANDSAT AND BAUXITE EXPLORATION A study was made by the CSIRO Division of Exploration Geoscience of thepotential value of LANDSAT imagery for bauxite exploration and developmentin the Weipa, Cape Weymouth district in far north Queensland. Slide 17 shows the image given by the raw data from three of the satellite'sspectral scanning bands. The picture is fairly homogeneous and of littleapparent value to mineral explorers. The large white area centre left isthe Weipa Mine site. The black to green-brown areas to the east and south-eastare grass fire burns. In Slide 18 the previous image has been enhanced by various means to reveala great deal more spectral viability than is shown by the raw data. Ifthis variability can be related to bauxite geochemistry, the potential ofLANDSAT imagery to bauxite exploration would also be considerably enhanced. (see also Slide 21) COSSA Slide 19 LANDSAT KEEPS TABS ON AGRICULTURE In this LANDSAT image of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA), the areasunder rice appear as the larger red rectangles. They are interspersed withwhitish rectangles representing mature winter cereal crops. The darker,more continuous red areas are fruit trees and other horticultural crops. Images such as this can be used to estimate the area under rice so as toensure accurate forecasts of transport and storage needs. They can alsogive an idea of how the amount of irrigation required for the crop mightaffect the water table. It is important to keep a watch on the amount ofwater used in this regard, so as to avoid any excessive rise in the watertable and consequent increase in soil salinity. In the past in the MIA this sort of information has been gathered by aerialphotography at a cost of about $200,000 per season. To do the job usingLANDSAT costs less than $60.00 per season, and there are further bonusesin the extra information that LANDSAT provides. COSSA Slide 20 LANDSAT KEEPS TABS ON WOMBATS! During a land use survey of the southern Nullarbor, CSIRO researchers werepuzzled by the bare patches of earth that appeared, dotted across the region,on their LANDSAT images. When they went out into the field to investigate, the base patches turnedout to be wombat warrens. Wombats graze around their warrens in expandingcircles and leave nothing but bare earth. This shows up clearly on LANDSATpictures as a white patch. Note the other features and information that can be gleaned from the LANDSATimage. The vermin-proof fence runs from top to bottom of the picture. Notice the marked difference in the grazing pressure on either side of it. The line across the bottom left-hand corner is a road. COSSA Slide 21 LANDSAT AND BAUXITE EXPLORATION In this enhanced image of the Cape Weymouth area, Weipa bauxite province,the bauxite plateau is clearly delineated. The intense red along creeksis probably mangrove swamp. COSSA Slide 22 SPOT REMOTE SENSING SATELLITE SEES MORE The French national remote sensing satellite, SPOT, launched during 1985,incorporates a number of advances over the LANDSAT satellites. Most importantly,it has a steerable mirror associated with its scanning system and so canscan not only a wider area but also the same area for a larger number ofpasses overhead. The steerable mirror also permits the production of stereoscopicimages. Data from the SPOT satellite is distributed in Australia through the AustralianCentre for Remote Sensing in Belconnen, ACT. COSSA Slide 23 HOW AUSTRALIA USES SATELLITES Australia makes great use of satellites for communications, weather forecasting,and remote sensing. The communications and weather satellites are in geostationary orbit atvarious locations around the earth, 36 000 kilometres above the equator. Two INTELSAT satellites, one above the Indian Ocean,, the other over thePacific, are used by Australia for sending and receiving telephone messagesand television pictures. The weather pictures Australians see on television and in the newspaperseach day are taken by the Japanese GMS (Geostationary Meteorological Satellite)located over Papua New Guinea. Australia now has all three of the first series AUSSAT satellites for domesticcommunications. These satellites dramatically improved telephone and televisionservices across the whole continent, especially in country and more remoteareas. In orbit very much closer to earth (about 1000 kilometres up) are variouspolar orbiting, remote-sensing and weather satellites used by Australiafor a multitude of purposes from mineral exploration to tracking ocean currentsand detecting fisheries resources. Each of the two NOAA (US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)satellites (NOAA-7 and NOAA-9) carries an Advanced Very High ResolutionRadiometer (AVHRR), permitting sensing of earth and ocean surface temperatures. The latest NOAA satellites (Advanced TIROS-N) also carry search-and-rescuetransponders. The LANDSAT satellites (currently LANDSAT-4 and LANDSAT-5) are earth resourcestechnology satellites launched in the 1970s and 1980s by the United States. The uses for their images appear to be limited only by the ingenuity ofthose concerned with remote sensing applications. Australian researchershave made great contributions to the field of LANDSAT image enhancement. SPOT is the French national remote sensing satellite, placed in orbit during1985. TRANSIT is a series of navigation satellites operated by the US navysince 1968, but now also in civilian use. COSSA Slide 24 INTELSAT COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES A depiction of one of the INTELSAT communications satellites located ingeostationary orbit at various points around the earth, 36 000 kilometresabove the equator. INTELSAT is also the acronym for the company, InternationalTelecommunications Satellite Organisation, set up in 1965 to operate globaltelecommunications satellite systems. It now has 106 member countries. Australia is the fourth largest shareholder. Two INTELSAT satellites areused by Australia, one above the Indian Ocean, the other above the Pacific. The INTELSAT satellites are now built by US companies and placed in orbitby space shuttle. COSSA Slide 25 OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS GROUND RECEIVING STATION Australian ground stations for receiving and transmitting messages throughthe Pacific and Indian Ocean INTELSATS are located at Moree, NSW (shownhere), Ceduna, SA, Carnarvon, WA, and just outside Melbourne. They areoperated by the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. COSSA Slide 26 HOW SATELLITES HAVE REDUCED THE COST OF OVERSEAS PHONE CALLS INTELSAT, the International Telecommunications Satellite Organisation, wasset up in 1965. Between then and 1977, there was a more than 10-fold increasein the number of international telephone calls. During the same period,the relative cost of making a call fell to about 20% of its opening value. This cost reduction is directly attributable to the operation of telecommunicationssatellites. COSSA Slide 27 AUSSAT, AUSTRALIA'S DOMESTIC COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES A depiction of AUSSAT, Australia's first domestic communications satellites. AUSSAT 1 was launched by shuttle in August 1985. AUSSAT 2 will followin 1988, and AUSSAT 3 later. AUSSAT 1 was built by the US company, HughesAircraft. It is a proven design. Fifty of its type have already been builtand launched. Hughes Aerospace has an offsets commitment to the Australian Governmentof more than $50 million arising from its space segment contracts with AUSSAT. About one-sixth of this commitment has been satisfied mainly in directAustralian content through wiring harness manufacture for the AUSSAT spacecraft,and communications monitoring system design and manufacture for AUSSAT'ssatellite control facilities. There are other areas in which Australianindustry could become involved. These include: * microwave integrated circuit design and manufacture * TWTA driver amplifiers and linearisers * spacecraft power control system electronics unit manufacture * spacecraft thermal blanket design and fabrication. COSSA Slide 28 AUSSAT, AUSTRALIA'S DOMESTIC COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES The first series of AUSSAT satellites, launched between August 1985 andSeptember 1987 distribute television. voice, and computer signals throughoutAustralia. Saucer-shaped antennae all over the country are used to receivethe transmitted AUSSAT signals. Some are 'receive-only' - mostly for televisionreception in the outback. Others on office buildings, at mines, or in countrytowns, both transmit and receive signals. With the launching of AUSSAT, people in even the most remote mining settlementhave begun to enjoy the same standards of communications as exist in thecities. COSSA Slide 29 THE GMS METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE VIEW OF AUSTRALIA The satellite pictures used in Australia for making the weather maps comefrom the Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) located 3,000kilometres above the equator at 1400E, over Papua New Guinea. It has aview off virtually a whole hemisphere, as shown here. Other geostationarymeteorological satellites are located at 00, 740E, 1350W, and 750W. COSSA Slide 30 GEOSTATIONARY METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE (GMS-3) The Geostationary Meteorological Satellites (GMS) were launched by the Japaneseto provide a weather service for the Asia-Pacific Region. They were builtfor the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan by Hughes Aerospaceand NEC. The GMS satellite currently operational is GMS-3, which came intoservice in 1984. COSSA Slide 31 AUSTRALIAN GMS RECEIVING STATION Transmissions from the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) arereceived by the Bureau of Meteorology through a Medium Data UtilisationStation (MDUS) located in the Bureau's Head Office in Melbourne. Signalsfrom the GMS are received by a 5-metre diameter dish antenna (seen here)located on the roof of the building in Lonsdale Street. COSSA Slide 32 AUSTRALIAN USERS OF LANDSAT DATA AND GMS WEATHER DATA Satellite meteorological data have a multitude of user groups in Australia,the biggest of which are aviation and the general public. Weather has astrong bearing on most human activities and systems such as satellite forecastingwhich enhance our ability to predict the weather generate strong interestand demand. Australians were quick to see the potential value of LANDSAT images to themanagement of this continent's vast resources and wide open spaces. Australianscientists began investigating the use of LANDSAT photographs soon afterthe first LANDSAT was launched in 1972. They were particularly interestedat that time in exploration for minerals. Now, fifteen years later and after much original research on image enhancement,Australians use LANDSAT images for a wide range of purposes. Geology, geography,and exploration are still at the head of the list with agricultural andpastoral purposes increasing. COSSA Slide 33 GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) NAVIGATION SATELLITES The Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation, also known as NAVSTAR,is based on 18 satellites, four of which have already been launched by theUS military. The satellites are about 19,652 kilometres (10,611 nauticalmiles) up. Using microwave signals, the GPS system will work day and night, in fogor rain, and provide an accuracy of 10 metres in both location and altitude. Ships, aircraft, and road vehicles will be able to navigate anywhere inAustralia using the system. Ships will be able to identify ocean currentsand will use this information to help reduce their fuel costs. Military users of NAVSTAR/GPS employ the encrypted P code, civilians usethe less accurate C/A code. It is expected that by the year 2000 the levelof accuracy achievable by the military system will be acknowledged and willbecome available to all users. COSSA Slide 34 AUSTRALIAN AVHRR ANTENNA This antenna was designed by the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research,and built by PCM Electronics Pty Ltd a Melbourne company, to receive AdvancedVery High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) pictures from the polar-orbitingNOAA weather satellites. AVHRR is the most spectacular of the instruments carried by the NOAA satellites. It scans five regions of the spectrum, from the visible to the infra-red,across a swathe 3000 kilometres wide and with a resolution down to 1 kilometre. AVHRR pictures are proving very useful to Australia in meteorology, oceanography,agriculture, environmental studies, etc. COSSA Slide 35 NOAA-AVHRR PICTURE OF THE LEEUWIN CURRENT The warm Leeuwin Current (deep yellow) swirls among the cooler water (brown)of the Indian Ocean. The coast of Western Australia is stark blue. Thispicture is a view from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)carried by the American NOAA polar-orbiting weather satellites. The radiometeris used here to map the temperature of the sea surface. CSIRO and Western Australian Institute of Technology researchers built theirown receiving station and processing equipment so that pictures such asthis could be produced. Sea surface temperatures help fisheries people to locate valuable catchesof fish. For instance, tuna are swept south by the warm Leeuwin Currentand also into any eddies formed from it. These are the places to beginlooking for fish. COSSA Slides 36 and 37 NOAA SATELLITES SEE VOLCANIC ASH The NOAA polar-orbiting weather satellites became vital in keeping aircraftlanes open during the eruption in 1982 of Mt. Galunggung in West Java. The ash clouds from the volcano were blown across the north-west of WesternAustralia, and there were near disasters when dust choked the engines oftwo airline jets. CSIRO and West Australian Institute of Technology scientists used theirNOAA tracking and receiving station to get a satellite picture of the cloudsover Broome. Slide 36 is unenhanced, false-colour image of the area. Waterappears as red and land as white. Normal clouds are blue. The ash cloudfrom the eruption of Mt. Galunggung can be seen running NW-SE just to thewest of Broome. The cloud is much more clearly delineated in Slide 37. The researchers were able to map the cloud by 'fingerprinting' it throughthe thermal properties of silicon dioxide, present only in the ash. COSSA Slides 38 and 39 ENHANCED NOAA IMAGES MAP SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURES Images from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) carriedby the Polar-orbiting NOAA weather satellites can be enhanced by selectinga range of intensities within an image and assigning a particular colourto each of the values within the range. By this means, detailed maps ofsea surface temperatures can be produced. Slide 38 is an unenhanced, false-colourimage of the Spencer Gulf are near Adelaide. In Slide 39 the image hasbeen enhanced by the method just described. Colour intervals signify temperaturedifferences of 0.40c. Red signifies 270c, blue 160c. The land appearsas black. COSSA Slide 40 NOAA-AVHRR IMAGE OF ANTARCTICA This Advance Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) image was taken bya NOAA polar-orbiting weather satellite as it passed over the edge of theAntarctic continent in the region of the Mertz Glacier (68oS, 145oE), AustralianAntarctic Territory. The glacier can be seen running diagonally at theleft of the image. This picture was received by the CSIRO Division of Oceanography'ssatellite receiving site that cannot be obtained by Australian receivingfacilities further North than Hobart. COSSA Slides 41 and 42 COASTAL ZONE COLOUR SCANNING OF NORTH QUEENSLAND The Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS) was a sensing device carried by thepolar-orbiting US remote-sensing satellite, NIMBUS. Slide 40 shows a CZCSimage of north Queensland with the string of small reefs making up abouthalf of the Great Barrier Reef just off the coast. Slide 42 is the samepicture but with a 'theme' painted on it. The theme in this instance isthe light reflected in the spectral band sensitive to chlorophyll. Thisgreen pigment is found in plants, so the theme is a measure of the concentrationof phytoplankton, tiny marine organisms that photosynthesize and are thefirst link in marine food chains. The yellow areas show the greatest concentrationof phytoplankton, the green slightly less, and the orange the smallest concentration. COSSA Slide 43 AIRCRAFT DEVELOPMENT OF SATELLITE SCANNERS AND SENSORS Satellite remote-sensing is a natural progression from aerial survey work. Much of the development work on the scanners and sensors that are eventuallyinstalled in satellites is done using specially equipped aircraft such asthis Fokker Friendship belonging to CSIRO. COSSA Slides 44 and 45 DETECTING BUSHFIRE HOT SPOTS FROM THE AIR The hot spots of bushfires (Slide 44) - often the areas of fires which needto be dealt with to bring them under control - are difficult to detect fromthe ground and, because of smoke, may not be visible from the air. They can, however, be readily 'seen' (Slide 45) by an aircraft-borne infra-redscanner. Scanners of this type are very similar to devices such as theAdvanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) carried by the NOAA satellites,but of course provide higher resolution because they fly closer to the ground. COSSA Slide 46 DENSITY SLICE, THERMAL IMAGE OF MITTA-MITTA RIVER In this image warm areas of the river appear as red and cold areas as blue. The researchers involved in this work were looking for cold areas, whichwould be soil moisture associated with seepage out of the river and thebeginnings of billabong formation. The scanner used to make this imagewas a Daedalus scanner of the CSIRO Division of Exploration Geoscience. COSSA Slide 47 FUNCTIONS OF COSSA The major goal of CSIRO's Office of Space Science and Applications (COSSA)is the establishment of a viable and competitive space industry in Australia. Its functions are directed towards this goal. * Coordinate CSIRO/Industry interactions * Provide project management for CSIRO space activities * Interact with other Australian Government instrumentalities involved,in space activities * Coordinate CSIRO's involvement in international space-related activities * Identify new opportunities for collaboration, and provide long-term planningof CSIRO's space activities * Allocate CSIRO funds for space R&D. COSSA Slide 48 AIMS OF A NATIONAL SPACE POLICY A national space policy is needed to provide the particular types of spacetechnology best suited to Australian conditions and requirements, by generatingindustrial involvement and employment, gaining access to international consortia,and capitalizing on technological spin-offs. COSSA Slide 49 CSIRO RESOURCES IN SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CSIRO already has substantial resources and expertise in space science andtechnology. In 1984, CSIRO's direct investment in space research was $1.4million. This research was being carried out in at least 15 Divisions ofthe Organization. COSSA Slide 50 HOW COSSA WILL DISTRIBUTE RESEARCH FUNDS Of the R&D funds it disburses, COSSA intends to allocate 80% of thetotal to applied science and the remainder to more fundamental research. Industry groups will get the mammoth share of all research funds - 70%- the rest going to CSIRO in-house research activities to support work inindustry. COSSA Slide 51 WHY AN AUSTRALIAN SPACE PROGRAM? ,Spacecraft are becoming an integral part of national and internationalsystems for communications, meteorology, resource management, surveillance,remote sensing, navigation, search-and-rescue, and national security. AnAustralian space program will bring great economic and social benefits tousers n many groups spread throughout the community. A strategically planned space program will also stimulate industrial development. Export sales of Australian built space equipment may partly offset fallingexport income from agricultural production. An operational space program will give Australia international influenceand access to data and systems reserved for members of the 'space club'. Last, but not least, the experience of other countries has pointed up theenormous technological spin-offs that come from industrial involvement inspace R&D. COSSA Slide 52 LESSONS FROM THE CANADIAN SPACE PROGRAM Primed by government, the Canadian space industry has been particularlysuccessful. It now manufactures twice as much space technology as is usedin Canada. The Canadians now build their own communications satellitesand, against stiff competition, obtained the contract to supply Brazil'scommunications satellite, BRAZILSAT. The Canadian government 'volunteered'to provide the 'manipulator arm' for the US shuttle. It cost $130 millionto make this 'gift', but it gave the Canadians second-to-none experiencein robotics. The Canadians' problems were similar to those faced by Australia:- * A small population * Great distances * A hostile terrain * An agricultural and mineral-based economy * A serious brain drain of the best people * A strong temptation to buy imported technology. The Canadian Government's decision to invest in space R&D to help solvemany of these problems has paid off handsomely. COSSA Slide 53 HIGH TECHNOLOGY BENEFITS OF A SPACE INDUSTRY Through what we can term the 'technology amplifier', the establishment ofan Australian space industry can be expected to yield enormous financialrewards. Development of the skills, expertise, and technologies requiredto solve immediate and foreseeable needs will not only yield short-termreturns, but will also open up new vistas in diverse areas. The magnitudeof the returns from these technological spin-offs can only be guessed at. COSSA Slide 54 SOME ECONOMIC LESSONS FROM LANDSAT USE IN AUSTRALIA Although Australia has made great and innovative use of LANDSAT data, thegovernment approach to LANDSAT applications has been piecemeal. An AustralianLANDSAT Receiving Station was not opened until 1979, 7 years after the launchof LANDSAT 1. It was built by a Canadian firm. When the LANDSAT Station was opened, it was as an experimental rather thanan operational system, yet it was decided to attempt to achieve 100% costrecovery, a concept unheard of elsewhere in the world and against all notionsof fostering new technology. As a result, prices rose so much that thegrowth in innovative and economically important uses of LANDSAT data washalted. It is instructive to note that the Australian LANDSAT Station achievesthe highest cost recovery of any such facility in the world and its successin this regard is due to the large and sophisticated user community generatingdemand for its products. Technological changes in the space sector will mean that the Alice SpringsLANDSAT facility will be unable to receive remote sensing data after 1986. No decisions have been made as yet, but there is not doubt that we willbe forced, by operational requirements, to quickly purchase new ground systemsfrom overseas suppliers. While Australia has the technical ability to produceits own ground systems it will not have the time to do so. COSSA Slide 55 OPERATIONAL EARTH OBSERVATION SATELLITES There are currently 10 operational earth observation satellites. Way out in geostationary orbit, about 36,000 kilometres above the equator,are the various weather satellites:- GMS, launched by Japan, provides weather services for the Asian-Pacificregion. Located above Papua New Guinea, this is the satellite from whichAustralia receives its weather pictures. GOES-W and GOES-E (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) werelaunched by the US in the early 1980s. They were built for NOAA (NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration) by Hughes Aerospace in the US. The two GOES satellites observe the western and eastern United States andthe adjacent ocean areas, but their coverage extends well into the SouthernHemisphere. The satellites make day and night observations of weather inthe coverage area, monitor cataclysmic weather events such as hurricanesand other severe storms, relay meteorological observation data from surfacecollection points to a processing centre, and perform facsimile transmissionof processed graphic and imaged weather data to field stations METEOSAT is the European geostationary meteorological satellite. It wasbuilt for the European Space Agency by the French company Aerospatiale,and is now operated by Eumetsat. INSAT satellites are Indian multipurpose satellites, combining communications,broadcast, and meteorology. They were built by the US company Ford Aerospacefor the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and launched by shuttlein 1982 and 1983. In orbit much closer to Earth (800-1000 kilometres) are the various polar-orbitingremote-sensing and weather satellites: LANDSAT-4 and 5, NOAA-7 and 9, andthe Russian METEOR. These variously carry an array of instruments to senseconditions at the land and sea surface and in the atmosphere. COSSA Slide 56 LANDSAT FLIGHT SEGMENT The drawing in this slide names the various parts of the current generationof LANDSAT remote-sensing satellites. The multispectral scanner (MSS) hasbeen the primary earth-observing instrument on these spacecraft for overa decade. The thematic mapper (TM) was flown as a new R&D sensor onLANDSAT-4. It became operational (on LANDSAT-5) on 31 August 1984. Australiawill be unable to receive TM data until the Australian LANDSAT Station isupgraded. COSSA Slide 57 TIROS/NOAA POLAR-ORBITING ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITE The TIROS/NOAA spacecraft are US polar-orbiting meteorological satellites,some carrying Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR), searchand rescue transponders, and ARGOS data platform transponders. They provideoperational coverage of the entire earth four times per day. The purposeof these satellites is to make measurements of temperature and humidityin the earth's atmosphere, surface temperature, cloud coverage, water-iceboundaries, and proton and electron flux near the earth. They are ableto receive, process, and retransmit data from balloons, buoys, and remoteautomatic stations distributed around the globe, and can also track stationsthat are in motion. The latest satellites also carry a Search and Rescuetransponder. COSSA Slide 58 SARSAT SEARCH-AND-RESCUE SATELLITES SARSAT (Search-and-Rescue Satellite) is a system of transponders on NOAA(US) and COSPAS (USSR) satellites for detecting emergency beacons on aircraftand ships. It is an experimental system operated by US, USSR, France, Canada,UK and Sweden. COSSA Slide 59 SPACE STATION COMPLEX The space station complex is a US proposal for a manned space station andassociated spacecraft in permanent orbit. NASA is seeking overseas collaborationin this project. The proposed complex would consist of a core platform and co-orbiting platformin low inclination, low altitude (500 kilometre) orbit as well as polarplatform(s) at a high altitude (NOAA is proposing 800 kilometres). Thepolar platform would contribute to the operational monitoring of the earth'satmosphere, oceans, and land masses. The payload for the platform wouldinclude instruments derived from the current operational environmental satellites,ocean satellites that will be flown by several countries during the nextdecade, research programs, and land satellite systems - governmental andcommercial. These justify two polar-orbiting, sun synchronous, astronaut-servicedplatforms. The availability of permanent, astronaut-serviced platformsof this type will render obsolete the expendable satellites used today. COSSA Slides 60 and 60a SPACE STATION POLAR PLATFORM NOAA (US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) envisages twopolar platforms of this type giving a permanent presence in space by themid-1990s. The platforms will be routinely serviced by astronauts at operationalaltitudes. They will carry 17 instruments for total operational viewingof the land, oceans, and atmosphere, as well as for monitoring of the solarenvironment, for search and rescue, and for environmental data collection. Data dissemination will be by direct readout at ground stations and delayed-recordedtransmissions, as well as by use of the Tracking and Data Relay SatelliteSystem (TDRSS). The platforms will maximize use of existing satellite sensor technology. They also aim to maximize international cooperation in space activities. Slide 60a describes the concept. COSSA Slide 61 LANDSAT TDRS COVERAGE US Tracking Data relay Satellites (TDRS) are designed to allow NASA to obtaindata worldwide from low-earth-orbiting spacecraft, such as LANDSAT, withoutneed for ground stations or on board recording. TDRS East is located at 410W longitude; TDRS West at 1710W. They allowthe US to pick up LANDSAT data from the areas shown on this slide. Theonly area of the earth that is not covered by either TDRS is a small silvercentre over India. COSSA Slide 62 LANDSAT ORBIT This diagram shows a typical orbit. LANDSAT provides almost global coveragefrom its position in near polar orbit. Like other polar satellites, LANDSATis sun-synchronous. However, its orbit is adjusted periodically to maintainfixed orbital paths. There are 233 fixed orbital paths spaced equally aroundthe earth. Each path is covered once every 16 days. Orbit Characteristics Orbit Type: Near polar, sun-synchronous Orbit Period: 98.9 minutes Altitude (Circular) : 706 km Orbit Time (Equator Crossing): 9.45 am local Longitudinal Separation of Adjacent Orbits: 811 km, 24.70 longitude Sensor Cross Track Scans at the Equator: 185 km COSSA Slide 63 THE AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR REMOTE SENSING (ACRES) This diagram summarises the various operations of the Australian Centrefor Remote Sensing, which consists of the Alice Springs data acquisitionfacility and the Canberra data processing facility. The Australian Centrefor Remote Sensing operates under a Memorandum of Understanding betweenthe Division of National Mapping (NATMAP) of the Department of ........and the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). COSSA Slide 64 LANDSAT ORBITS OVER AUSTRALIA This diagram shows the LANDSAT-4 coverage accessible by the Australian Centrefor Remote Sensing. The near vertical lines are orbital paths, each numbered. LANDSAT has 233 fixed orbital paths; images from 37 of them can be receivedby the Australian station. COSSA Slide 65 WORLD COLLECTION OF LANDSAT MSS DATA This map shows the ground stations around the world able to collect LANDSAT-4MSS (Multi-Spectral Scanner) data. The MSS has been the primary earth-observinginstrument on LANDSAT spacecraft for over a decade. The Thematic Mapper(TM) was flown as a new R&D sensor on LANDSAT-4. It became operational(on LANDSAT-5) in August 1984. The Australian Landsat Station is not yetequipped to receive TM data. COSSA Slide 66 LANDSAT MULTI-SPECTRAL SCANNING (MSS) The MSS scans the earth across the satellite path providing images 185kmwide. There are 24 detectors (6 for each of 4 spectral bands). Each band measuresreflected light in the visible or near infrared. Each picture element (pixel)covers 80 metres by 80 metres on the earth and is quantized to 64 levels. COSSA Slide 67 LANDSAT THEMATIC MAPPER (TM) The Thematic Mapper (TM) was flown as a new R&D sensor on LANDSAT-4. It became operational (on LANDSAT-5) on 31 August 1984. It provides muchmore powerful data than its predecessor the Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS). There are 100 detectors (16 of each of 6 reflective bands and 4 for oneemissive band). MSS has 24 detectors. The reflective bands measure light in the visible or near infrared. EachTM picture element (pixel) is 30 metres by 30 metres. MSS pixels are 80metres square. The emissive band measures temperature in the infrared, for 120 metre squarepixels. Both reflective and emissive bands are quantized to 256 levels. The spectral range covered by TM is from 0.45 to 2.35um, as compared with0.5 to 1.1um by MSS. The Australian Centre for Remote Sensing cannot receive TM data. Indeed,unless it is upgraded it will be unable to receive LANDSAT data after 1986. COSSA Slide 68 SARSAT/COSPAS SEARCH AND RESCUE The United States NOAA polar-orbiting spacecraft carry, as well as weatherand environmental sensors, Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT)payloads, which are provided by Canada and France. The USSR also operatespolar-orbiting satellites as part of its spacecraft navigation system andsome carry similar SARSAT payloads. The USSR SARSAT payload is called COSPAS. COSSA Slide 69 SARSAT SEARCH AND RESCUE SYSTEM This slide gives the principles of the SARSAT system. Aircraft and shipscarry emergency locator transmitters (ELTs). In the event of mishap, theELT signal is picked up by the search-and-rescue antenna of a passing NOAAor Cosmos satellite and positional data relayed to the local user terminal. From there the information is used to direct search and rescue forces. COSSA Slide 70 SPARTAN SCIENTIFIC SATELLITE/MIRRABOOKA SPARTAN is a reusable satellite developed by NASA in the USA. The SPARTANcarrier provides access to space for periods of a few hours to several days. The carrier is taken into orbit by the space shuttle, deployed, operatedas an autonomous sub-satellite, and retrieved and returned to the groundfor subsequent reuse. COSSA is presently investigating the establishment of an Australian researchsatellite, MIRRABOOKA. Based in part on SPARTAN, it would provide Australianindustry with substantial space manufacturing experience before the lettingof contracts for the manufacture of AUSSAT-2. COSSA considers that theMIRRABBOKA program is the best means for Australian industry to achievesignificant participation in AUSSAT-2. MIRRABOOKA is also ideally suitedfor fundamental and applied science experiments of interest to the Australiancommunity - in remote sensing, astronomy, and in the study of the equatorialionosphere. COSSA Slide 71 SPARTAN EVOLUTION The chart in this slide shows current and potential developments in SPARTANsatellites. COSSA Slides 72 and 73 SCENARIOS FOR AN AUSTRALIAN SPACE PROGRAM These slides give in diagrammatic form forecast expenditures on space-relatedactivities in Australia on the basis of existing projects and the plannedAustralian Space Program. COSSA Slide 74 OPERATIONAL WEATHER SATELLITES There are five weather satellites in geostationary orbit about 36000 kilometresabove the equator; GOES-East and GOES-West (USA), METEOSAT (European SpaceAgency), INSAT (India), and GMS (Japan). Australia gets its weather picturesfrom GMS, which is positioned over Papua New Guinea. Much closer to earth (altitude about 850 km) are the two, polar-orbitingweather and environmental satellites NOAA-6 and NOAA-9. COSSA Slide 75 COVERAGE OF THE INTERNATIONAL WEATHER SATELLITES This slide shows the coverage of the five geostationary meteorological satellites. COSSA Slides 76 and 77 VEGETATION INDEX AND DROUGHT Through advances in satellite remote-sensing technology, we can now gaina continental-scale impression of the effects of significant environmentalevents. The two images of Australia presented in these slides come from 1982, thefirst from April, the second from December, when most of the country experiencea severe drought. The images were composed from data collected by the UnitedStates' NOAA polar-orbiting, environmental satellites, whose sensors scana track 2800 km wide. Measurements of the light in specific wavelengthsreflected from the land surface were collected over weekly periods and transformedto a 'vegetation index' based on 'greenness'. A pronounced feature in the first slide is the flush of vegetation overmost of the Northern Territory, resulting from the passage of a cyclone. Note that the colours chosen for these particular images are such thatthe 'greenest' areas appear as mauve. These are the native eucalypt forestsand woodlands. The prime agricultural and grazing lands in the south andwest appear as blue-green and yellow, while the arid centre is brown. The second slide shows how much the drought has deepened during the year. There is some remnant of the cyclone's effects in the north, but the dryzone has extended and the drought has intensified in the agricultural areas,particularly in the east. COSSA Slide 78 SPACE TELESCOPE An artist's depiction of the space telescope, a joint NASA/ESA program. The space telescope which is 2.5m in diameter, was launched by shuttlein 1985. The European Space Agency's contributions to the telescope area special faint object camera and the solar array. COSSA Slide 79 ESA INFRARED SPACE OBSERVATORY (ISO) Artist's impression of the European Space Agency science progrma's infraredspace observatory, consisting of a hellium cooled telescope with a minimumlifetime of 18 months. It is expected that ISO will be lauched by ARIANEin 1990. COSSA Slide 80 EXOSAT, X-RAY OBSERVATORY SATELLITE A model of the European Space Agency's scientific satellite EXOSAT againsta projection of the Whilrpool Galaxy in "Canes Venatici". EXOSATis Europe's first X-ray observatory satellite. It was built by the Germancompany MBB and lauched on Thor/Delta on 26 May 1983 from the NASA testrange in California. CSIRO Slide 81 GIOTTO AND HALLEY'S COMET Artist's impression of the European Space Agency spacecraft GIOTTO approachingHalley's Comet. The arrows indicate that the protective dust shield ofGIOTTO is facing the comet. GIOTTO was built by a British Aerospace-ledconsortium, launched on ARIANE in July 1985, and it met up with the famouscomet in March 1986. Data transmitted during the critical few hours of closest encounter wassent to ESA via the 64-metre Parkes Radiotelescope which was in line withthe spacecraft at the time and able to pick up its signals. COSSA Slide 82 GIOTTO UNDER CONSTRUCTION This photograph shows the flight unit of the spacecraft GIOTTO undergoingtests in Toulouse, France. COSSA Slides 83 and 84 LANDSAT DETECTS DUST SOURCES IN ADELAIDE Dust has been a perennial problem in Adelaide. Its reduction has becomean economic problem with the development of high technology industry there. However, before the dust hazard can be reduced its source must be found. This is where LANDSAT came in. Using quick and cheap (total cost lessthan $100) techniques for processing LANDSAT images the areas of bare groundwhere the dust comes from were revealed. Other methods had already absorbedmore than $20 000 and several years of work without defining the extentof the problem. Slide 83 shows an enhanced LANDSAT image of the Adelaide area. Slide 84has a "theme" painted on it, the theme being the light reflectedby bare ground. The sources of dust clearly show as yellow areas, someof them virtually surrounding Adelaide's Technology Park. COSSA Slides 85 and 86 LANDSAT IMAGES AND CHANNEL COUNTRY LAND MANAGEMENT The two images in these slides are of a section of Cooper Creek in the QueenslandChannel Country about 100 km east of Haddon Corner. In Slide 85, the creek is 60 kilometres wide and in full flood, and willcontinue on to fill Lake Eyre. The blue represents turbid water, whilethe black areas are waterlogged soils. This image was taken on 16 February1974. Slide 86 shows the same area on 23 July after another, earlier flood. Thered areas show healthy vegetation that has been stimulated by the floodwater. Information on the size and spread of floodwaters across the Channel Countryis of great potential value to the managers of pastoral properties thatabut the flood plain, for it would allow them to determine the numbers ofcattle that could be brought in from other areas for fattenting and howlong the pastures would be safely able to carry these cattle. LANDSAT cannow provide the pastoral industry with information on both the extent offlooding and the subsequent production of fodder for stock. No other methods,including aerial photography, can be considered to be as cost effective. COSSA Slide 87 ANECHOIC CHAMBER AT CSIRO RADIOPHYSICS The Division of Radiophysics has built an anechoic chamber (12 x 6 x 4.5m)which operates at frequencies above 1.5 GHz. This is used for measuringthe frequency characteristics of antennae designed for small earth stations. The Division is very much involved in the development of technology forspace-based communications. COSSA Slide 88 ERS-1, OBJECTIVES AND AUSTRALIAN INVOLVEMENT ERS-1 (ERS, Earth Resources Satellite) is the first satellite in the EuropeanSpace Agency's remote sensing program, due for launch aboard ARIANE in 1990. Its prime function will be surveillance of the oceans and coastal zones,including ice monitoring. ERS-1 is being built by the German company, Dornier. It will be the first of the new generation of radar-equipped, remote-sensingsatellites, which can "see" day or night, through clear or cloudyskies. As well as radar, ERS-1 will carry the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR). The ATSR is a collaborative project between the Science and EngineeringCouncil of the U.K. and CSIRO. The ATSR is an enhanced version of the AdvancedVery High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) carried on the U.S. NOAA satellites. It can measure sea surface temperature to + 0.3oC, and thus provide informationof value in meteorology, oceanography, and fisheries. The Division of Atmospheric Research is playing a leading role in the ATSRproject, a member of the Division having been one of the originators ofthe concept being implemented in ATSR. At the initial suggestion of COSSA,the digital electronics package for ATSR will be manufactured by an Australiancompany, under a sub-contract to its U.K. parent, with funding from theDepartment of Industry, Technology and Commerce. COSSA Slide 89 ERS-1 IN SPACE An artist's impression of ERS-1 in orbit. The spacecraft is due for launchin 1990. COSSA Slide 90 R & D FUNDING TOP REQUIREMENT TO INITIATE SPACE INDUSTRY What are the factors seen by industry as limiting development of an Australianspace industry? A COSSA-commissioned industry survey yielded the rankingof 14 key factors shown in this slide. The provision of government R&Dfunding is at the head of the stairs, with a number of other government-controlledfactors near the top. COSSA Slide 91 PARKES RADIOTELESCOPE The Division of Radiophysics' 64m radiotelescope at Parkes has played abig part in various space missions. For example, it was used in 1969 toreceive the first pictures of the Apollo II moon landing. NASA had askedCSIRO to make the antenna available as a backup. When the moon walk wasabout to start, Command Centre at Houston was receiving picture informationfrom several stations, but that from Parkes was of the best quality. Thedata were relayed from Parkes by landline to Sydney, then to the OTC stationat Moree, up to the Pacific Intelsat satellite, and down to Houston to beseen by 600 million viewers in 49 countries. COSSA Slide 92 COASTAL ZONE COLOUR SCANNING OF GREAT BARRIER REEF The Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS) is a sensing device carried by thepolar-orbiting US remote-sensing satellite, NIMBUS. This slide is a mosaicof two CZCS scenes which together provide coverage of almost all of theGrat Barrier Reef. The top half of the slide is part of an overpass on18 April 1981; the bottom half is from an overpass on 11 August 1979. COSSA Slide 93 "PIXELS" The pictures produced by LANDSAT and other remote-sensing satellites aremade up of picture elements, or pixels. Each pixel corresponds to the averagebrightness in one of the four LANDSAT bands of an 80 metre square area ofthe image. There are 7 1/2 million pixels in one standard 185 kilometresquare LANDSAT MSS (Multi-Spectral Scanner) image. This image, of a well-knownstatesman from times past, illustrates the nature of pixels. COSSA Slide 94 SPACE R & D BUDGETS 1984 The nations with a significant competence in space technology have all achievedthis with a sustained program of government spending. In 1984, the largestspace expenditure was that of the US (US$7500 million) which in dollar termswas more than 12 times greater as the second biggest commitments, thoseof Japan (US$600 million) and France (US$540 million). Germany (US$279million) was next, at less than half of that of France, and India (US$149million). Canada (US$114 million), and the UK (US$109 million) follow withhalf the German budget. These budgets can be expressed as percentages of gross domestic product(GDP) or as per capita values. In these terms, they indicate that a percapita expenditure of US$4-5 and a level of 0.04% of GDP yield a moderatespace effort. COSSA Slide 95 LANDSAT MAPS ALGAL BLOOMS Summer growth of algae is a recurring problem in the Peel/Harvey Inlet areaof Mandurah, Western Australia. During recent summers, LANDSAT has beenused to monitor and map the spread of weed. By using combinations of LANDSAT'sspectral bands and image classification, the density and amount of weedcan be calculated rapidly. COSSA Slide 96 LANDSAT MONITORS LAND USE CHANGES A land use project by the Darling Range (Western Australia) Study Groupdemonstrated that LANDSAT is a cost-effective method of updating land useinformation. Land use data for the project were supplied from existingaerial photography and maps dating from 1969. LANDSAT broad scale classificationof the study area was used to update that database. The colour-coded landuse and forestry density LANDSAT map is accompanied by a report giving theareas in each category. COSSA Slide 97-99 PRODUCTION OF LANDSAT MSS IMAGES These three slides summarize in graphic form all stages in the productionof LANDSAT multi-spectral scanner images; from the sensing of reflectedsolar radiation by the spacecraft, to the ground reception and processingof digitized images, to the making of colour prints. COSSA Slides 100 and 101 NOAA-AVHRR VIEW OF THE EAST AUSTRALIAN CURRENT Slide 100 gives a spectacular view of the tail end of the East AustralianCurrent, a warm current that flows south down the east coast. This pictureis a view from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) carriedby the American NOAA polar-orbiting satellites. The radiometer is usedhere to map the temperature of the sea surface. Warm water appears as red,and cold as blue, with colour gradations between. Eddies are characteristicof the southern end of the East Australian Current, warm water breakingoff and drifting down the east coast of Tasmania, as seen in this imageand in Slide 101. Southern ocean pictures such as this are a speciality of the CSIRO Divisionof Oceanography's NOAA-AVHRR receiving facility in Hobart. COSSA Slide 102 NOAA-AVHRR VIEW OF SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURES AROUND TASMANIA A view from the Advance Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) carriedby the American NOAA polar-orbiting satellites. The radiometer is usedhere to map the temperature of the sea surface. Warm water appears as red,and cold as blue, with colour graduations reflecting intermediate temperatures. This image was produced by the CSIRO Division of Oceanography's NOAA-AVHRRreceiving facility in Hobart. COSSA Slide 103 NOAA-AVHRR REVEALS EASTWARD FLOW OF LEEUWIN CURRENT This composite picture shows the warm Leeuwin Current flowing eastward acrossthe Great Australian Bight. The picture is made up of a series of views,taken over a week, from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)carried by the American NOAA polar-orbiting satellites. The radiometeris used here to map the temperature of the sea surface. Warm water appearsas red, and cold as blue, with colour gradations reflecting intermediatetemperatures. The eastward flow of the current, previously thought to peter out past thesouth-west tip of Australia, was discovered by researchers at the CSIRODivision of Oceanography's satellite image receiving station at Hobart. COSSA Slide 104 RADAR VIEWS OF VENUS An image of the surface of Venus captured by the radar scanner of a Sovietspacecraft. COSSA Slide 105 SATELLITES PERMIT CONTINENTAL-SCALE MANAGEMENT Remote-sensing satellites provide the data that permit a total change inthe concept of managing a continent such as Australia. COSSA Slide 106 'ASH WEDNESDAY' BUSHFIRES A view of Victoria on 17 February 1983, the day after the 'Ash Wednesday'bushfires. This picture was obtained after using the CSIRO System for InteractiveData Analysis to process data collected by the polar-orbiting satellite,NOAA-6. Image enhancement has made burnt-out areas and smoke plumes clearlyvisible. COSSA Slide 107 SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES FROM CSIDA One important application of image enhancement concerns the detailed recordingof sea surface temperatures by processing satellite infrared radiometerreadings. Shown here is the Spencer Gulf area near Adelaide. The colourintervals signify temperature differences of 0.4oC. COSSA Slide 108 CSIDA SHOWS THE 'MELBOURNE EDDY' Fogs are common on winter mornings in Melbourne. At the height of a foga brisk westerly breeze often springs up and one might reasonably expectthis to dissipate the fog; it rarely does. The reasons for the phenomenonwere predicted to lie in the physical geography of Melbourne and its surrounds; the Dandenongs and other high country to the east were blocking the windflow and therefore the clearance of the fog. This was subsequently confirmedby this NOAA satellite image which shows fog entrained in what has beendubbed the 'Melbourne eddy'! COSSA Slide 109 SPACE STATION POLAR PLATFORM Impression of a NOAA-proposed polar platform. These platforms would replacethe expendable remote-sensing satellites aloft today and would be servicedby astronauts at operational altitudes. The polar platforms, probably twoof them, should be aloft by the mid-1990's. A number of CSIRO Divisions, and other Australian researchers, are respondingto international Announcements of Opportunity to provide instruments tofly on these platforms and to use the data that will be collected from them. COSSA Slide 110 INTERSCAN From its work in radioastronomy, the Division of Radiophysics has acquiredgreat skills in antenna design and development. These have been expressedin projects such as the Interscan aircraft landing system and, more recently,in the development of earth station antennae for OTC. COSSA Slide 111 SPACE STATION COMPLEX Details of the complex of orbits and craft proposed by NASA for the first,permanent presence in space by the mid-1990s.

COSSA Slide 115 GIOTTO GROUND STATIONS During its cruise phase the Giotto spacecraft was controlled by a numberof ground stations around the World. Depending on their size and equipment,the ground stations were used for different purposes and different missionphases. In Australia, stations at Parkes, Carnarvon, and Tidbinbilla wereinvolved in the Giotto mission. The CSIRO radio telescope at Parkes wasthe sole collector of data during Giotto's close encounter with Halley'scomet. COSSA Slide 116 COMBINED LANDSAT/AIRBORNE SCANNER IMAGERY The use of airborne radiometers to measure radioactivity from potassium,uranium, and thorium, coupled with a normal Landsat image, has proven auseful technique in geological survey work.

They will become an element in the world wide system of synthesistelescopes. The Australia Telescope will be an important component of thetotal space/ground system. The Division of Radiophysics is participating in the European QUASAT phaseA studies which began in April 1986 and the USSR Radioastron project, duefor launch in 1992. Australian participation in such missions will provideAustralian industry with an opportunity to participate in a state-of-the-artCommunications technology, including low noise amplifiers, and extremelyprecise time and phase standardization procedures. This will provide opportunitieswith space qualification that will be relevant to future generation communicationsspacecraft.

COSSA Slide 169 CZCS IMAGE OF TASMAN SEA OFF SYDNEY During 1986 the Division of Oceanography in Hobart became the first non-NASAsatellite remote sensing station in Australia to receive images from theNimbus 7 satellite, resulting in increased knowledge of biological activityin the oceans that could prove beneficial to Australia's fishing industry. The Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS) instrument carried by Nimbus sensedsubtle changes in the colour of ocean water. The biomass of planktonicplants in surface water is an important determinant of ocean colour. Itis possible to correlate information on the chlorophyll content in the surfacelayer with biological activity.

COSSA Slide 186 NOAA DATA AID OCEANOGRAPHIC CRUISES The CSIRO Division of Oceanography now uses 'real time' NOAA data to helplocate significant oceanographic features during research cruises. Duringa cruise in October 1986, researchers were able to steer the R V Franklinto hit the "bulls-eye" of a large gyre south-east of Victoria. The track of the Franklin is superimposed on this NOAA image of sea-surfacetemperatures, in the same way that the Captain of the ship could see thespace-age view of where he was going.

COSSA Slide 196 OTC SYDNEY ANTENNA A CSIRO-industry consortium designed and built the 18m OTC Intelsat antennashown here being erected at Oxford Falls on the outskirts of Sydney. COSSA Slide 197 TDRSS/QUASAT In an experiment carried out during 1986, the Tracking and Data Relay SatelliteSystem (TDRSS), operated for NASA by Spacecom, was used in conjunction with64m radio telescopes in Australia and Japan to perform very long baselineinterferometry (VLBI) in space. Using this technique it has been possibleto obtain angular resolution equivalent to that of a radio telescope witha diameter 1.4 times the size of the earth. This experiment was carriedout to test the technical feasibility of the QUASAT (QUAsar SATellite) projectfor an orbiting radio telescope. Australian scientists are participatingin these studies. The project may eventually offer significant opportunitiesfor Australian industry to participate in the manufacture of space sectorequipment.

COSSA Slide 221 - 228 THE AUSTRALIA TELESCOPE One of Australia's major Bicentennial projects, the Australia Telescope(AT) opened in September 1988. It is not only a major technological masterpiecethat will extend the frontiers of the known universe but also is almostentirely made in Australia. This series of slides shows the constructionof the Telescope which is based in Culgoora, NSW. Slide 228 shows the location of the seven rail-mounted antennae at Culgooraand additional antennas at Siding Springs and CSIRO's Parkes Radiotelescopewhich now forms part of the AT. Over 80% of the AT's $50 million budget was spent in Australia. 24 Australiancompanies made major contributions with the result that the project contributedsignificantly to the development of Australia's high technology industries. The most visible contracts were those of Barclay Brothers for the railwayline, and Evans Deakin Industries for the antenna structures. MacDonaldWagner was responsible for the structural design and Austek Microsystemsworked with the Division of Radiophysics on the correlator chip - a crucialcomponent of the Telescope. The project also involved the design and constructionof low noise receivers, a fibre optics signal network linking the antennas,systems to correlate signals from pairs of antennas, servo-control systemsfor controlling the antennas and computing facilities to control the instrumentand handle incoming data.

Realdepth data is compared to the interpolated depth data and the 'exposure'of reef morphology to a nominated wind and wave direction has been interpretedfor both depth data files. 308 A comparison between land surface inventory mapping using Landsat MSSand TM data sets. Both files have been rectified to remove sensor and panoramicdistortions and then registered to a common map base. The MSS data hasbeen resampled to a 30 metre pixel enhancing onscreen comparison betweenthe two classifications. 309 Landsat MSS data imaged over China's loess plateau. Raw data displayedas a standard false colour composite is contrasted by a density sliced curvatureanalysis. Pixel spectral properties and neighbour associations have beenused to give a first order approximation of landform. 310 Synoptic scale landcover classification using CZCS data. Landcoverclassifications were developed in three distinct subsets of this scene. The classifications were then merged, class overlap and redundancy removed,and then the classification was applied to the whole scene. 311 SE Australia represented by AVHRR data which have been rectified andresampled to a geographical grid. The Murray Darling drainage basin andits component divisions were digitised and written into a channel of theimage. A digital elevation model has also been incorporated to providean impression of surface relief. 312 Again the Murray Darling, imaged at night using AVHRR thermal data. The sub catchment digital strings have been used as a template and thoseareas outside the region have been digitally masked. 313 In this version of the scene only the digital strings and the DEM havebeen used. The various subcatchments have been digitally labelled and colourcoded. The landform outside the strings is represented by the DEM. 314 In this case the DEM forms the perimeter data set whilst within thearea of the catchments a raw AVHRR data greyscale has been employed to highlightsurface features. The subcatchments are numbered and the state capitalsare labelled.

The intention is to capitaliseon the knowledge thus gained to develop a spaceborne scanner to internationalstandards for launch in the mid 1990's. CSIRO is discussing, with the Bureauof Meteorology and the Australian Space Office, the prospects for jointdevelopment of the instrument as an Australian component of the internationalmeteorological satellite system. Notes on COSSA Slides 340 - 348 Slide 340 Names Names of the people involved. Slide 341 Location of the A-band The solar spectrum is crossed by the black Fraunhoffer lines. The linemarked A is the oxygen A-band. The colours on the slide are deceptive becausethe A-band is actually in the near infrared and is invisible to the eye. The slide has been taken with film whose response extends into the infrared. Slide 342 Location of the A-band The oxygen A-band in the solar absorption spectrum is flanked by absorptionbands for water and ozone, but fortunately the bands do not overlap. Thus,oxygen is essentially the only absorber between 759 and 771 nm, a fact whichsimplifies interpretation of the data. Slide 343 Structure of the A-band This slide shows the A-band with increasing spectral resolution. Earlierwork on remotely sensed surface pressure from A-band observations has usedthe broadest resolution shown, whereas our studies indicate that the finestresolution is required if the aerosol problem is to be overcome. The band consists of two branches, labelled P and R, with the R branch atshorter wavelengths. With the exception of one singlet line in the P branch,all lines occur in doublets. Slide 344 Simplified data interpretation The relected radiance depends on: (1) F, the solar constant; (2) r, the reflection coefficent of the sea; (3) , the satellite zenith angle; (4) m, the air - mass; (5) , the optical path length from pressure level p to space. If the frequency is measured from the centre of an absorption line,and if is at least comparable with the line width, conditions whichare satisfied in practice, then the optical path length is Thus, observations at two frequencies, and , can be used to inferthe surface pressure p, since Slide 345 Impact of scattered radiation The primary difficulty we face is to distinguish between radiation reflectedfrom the surface and radiation scattered in the atmosphere. Scattered radiationgenerally traverses a shorter path, sees less oxygen, suffers less absorption,and so leads to an underestimate of the surface pressure. Slide 346 and Slide 347 The case for a multi-channel spectrometer If it were not for scattering, two channels would be sufficient, as indicatedabove. The motivation for a multichannel instrument is best seen in the3D plot of the contribution to the radiance from a scattering event at levelp and frequency . The frequency axis in the 3D plot is measured from thecentre of any one of the oxygen lines. The scattered radiation surfaceshows a prominent ridge, which means that to each frequency there correspondsa particular pressure level where the contribution to scattering is at amaximum. In other words, each frequency channel responds to a scatteringat a particular level. This is analoguous to temperature sounding of theatmosphere, in which each channel sees the black body radiation form a different atmosphericlevel. By combining observations at several frequencies, one can resolvethe scattered and reflected radiation. This argument suggests that we need only observe one oxygen line, whereas,in the instrument we have proposed, we plan to monitor alol the lines inthe A-band. There are two reasons why we do so. (1) The spectrum will be spread over a linear detector array, and all theapparatus will tell us is the intensity at the i pixel, i=1,...,1024. We must establish a map which assigns a wavelength to each pixel beforewe can interpret the data. This task is clearly easier if we have the fullspectrum rather than a single line, so that we can identify all the characteristicfeatures of the spectrum. (2) The lines vary in strength from very weak to very strong, so the steepnessof the ridge will vary from line to line. Thus, each line will provideslightly different information, which will improve the resolution of reflectedand scattered radiation. Slide 348 Errors predicted from model studies. This slide shows the anticipated error in the recovered surface pressurearising from: (1) an uncertanty of 10% in the aerosol optical depth; (2) experimental noise of 0.1%; (3) an error of 1 K in the atmospheric temperature profile. The errors depend upon the brightness of the sea, whose relection coefficient,r, is plotted along the horizontal axis. The anticipated range for r liesbetween the arrows indicating 'bright sea' and 'dark sea'. Note that r is the biderectional reflection coefficient which describesthe reflection of radiation from a specified incident direction to a specifiedexit direction. The normalisation allows r > 1, odd though this mightseem at first. (There is no consistency in the literature concerning thedefinition of r. Some authors include 4 , others include geometric factorssuch as the secants of the incident and exit zentih angles). Slide 349 Grating recording This spectacular slide shows the recording of the holographic concave grating. The work was carried out by Ian Wilson at CSIRO Division of Materials Scienceand Technology. Slide 350 Manufacture of the prototype in DAR workshop The Division's computer controlled milling machine was used to fabricatethe optical bench and precisely position the mounts for the optical components. Slide 351 Schematic of the laboratory prototype In the lab experiment we are looking directly at the sun, in order to testthe equipment and the algorithm for recovering the pressure. The advantageof this configuration is not only the obvious one, that we can work in alab instead of an acoustic resonant cavity (F27), but also that singly scatteredradiance is lost from the solar beam. Only through multiple scatteringcan scattered radiance enter our spectrometer, and the probability of suchevents is low. Thus, interpretation of the data should be easier. (1) The spectrometer consists of an aberration corrected, holographicallyrecorded, concave diffraction grating with a linear detector array in thefocal plane. The grating has diameter 80 mm and optical speed f/6. Thedetector pixels have a 100:1 aspect ratio to maximise throughput. (2) The detector is cooled with a Joule-Thomso refrigerator. To date wehave not worried about cooling, because other noise sources have been sohigh. However, the time has now come to press it into service. We intendto operate the detector at -80C. (3) The spectrometer is housed in a vacuum chamber to stop atmosphericturbulence in the optical path and to stop heat conductions to the detectorarray. (4) The sun-tracker is controlled by the PC and has its sensor separatedfrom the mirror mount. Error signals from the sensor together with thepredicted position of the sun are used to compute corrections to the mirrororientation. (5) The surface pressure is montiroed by an anaeroid barometer with electronicreadout developed at DAR. (6) Ancillary data on the atmospheric structure and aerosol loading isobtained from the Bureau of Meteorology. Slide 352 Laboratory prototype The suntracker is outside the window. Only the rear side of the gratingis visible in the mount at the end of the vacuum tank. Getting the correctexposure for the bright window at one extreme and the dim computer screenat the other was a taxing task for our divisional photographer. I thinkthis shot required three exposures! Slide 353 A-band doublets The five doublets are shown as they appear when read directly from the detector. The doublets are approximately 0.5 nm apart, and the separation of lineswithin each doublet is approximately 0.1nm. Slide 354 A-band doublets This is the same information as in the preceding slide, except that it hasnow been captured by the PC replotted. In fact, the two traces were obtainedon different days, and the alignment of the optics had been changed in theinterim. Hence the differences in spectral range and resolution. Slide 355 Spectrometer entrance slit and detector assembly This shot had our photographer in ecstacy, even though the information contentof the slide is practically nil. It shows the entrance slit, fold mirrorand detector array bathed in a glorious solar spectrum, obtained by allowingsunlight to fall directly on the grating. Slide 356 Layout for the satellite instrument I have folded the instrument in two places in order to make it more compact. The alternative would be a long thin instrument. Physical dimensions areapproximately 500 x 325 x 200 mm. The mass and power dissipation will needto be estimated carefully, but both will be low, particularly the latter. Note that the sun will provide an excellent calibration source, becausewe are not asking for an absolute calibration of each detector pixel, butrather the relative calibration of one pixel against another. Consequently,the spectrum of the calibration source must either be flat across the narrowband of the spectrometer, or have small variation which can be monitored. What better than a calibration source that also can be seen from earth. Slide 357 Scan pattern The footprint pattern shown is simply a suggestion and should not be takentoo seriously for the following reasons. (1) The interpretation of the data is simplified if the reflected radiancedominates the scattered radiance, so we would attempt to steer the instrumentto look at the brightest areas of the sea. This will require the instrumentto either look ahead or behind, depending upon the season and the positionof the satellite. Consequently, a complex scan pattern might be necessary. (2) The spacing of the footprints is dictated by the integration time,and this depends upon both the brightness of the sea and the sensitivityof the detector. The pattern shown assumes an integration time of 1 secondper footprint, a figure arrived at from a sensitivity analysis for our prototype. I hope that this time can be reduced considerably. Slide 358 Data anlysis The central part of the interpretation algorithm is the radiative transfermodel for the atmosphere. It requires the following data: (1) visible and infrared data (OCTS) to detect clouds; (2) visible and near infrared data (OCTS) to monitor the aerosol opticaldepth (perhaps using the technique that Ross Mitchell and I suggested); (3) TOVS/AMSU data to determine the temperature profile; (4) an estimate for p, the surface pressure, and r, the bidirectional reflectioncoefficient of the sea. The output of the model is a predicition of the atmospheric pressure scanner(APS) data. The model predicition is then compared with the real data andthe estimates for p and r are refined until the agreement between the twois acceptable.

COSSA Slides 366 - 369 NSW DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE - WOODY VEGETATION MAPPING PROJECT A current priority of the Department of Agriculture in the western divisionis to evaluate methods of management of woody weed infestation. LandsatMSS data has been used for this project in the Cobar-Louth region of NSW. Methods to estimate the amount of woody cover per hectare have been developedand used to assess change from February 1975 to February 1987. Propertyand land system boundaries have been incorporated with the image data andareas of known management application can be monitored to determine theeffect of that application. This series of slides shows four sample imagesgenerated through this project. Slides 366 and 367 show the study area with property boundaries overlaidin white. Slide 368 and 369 both have been processed to show changes in woody coverin the given period. Slide 368 shows areas of increased woody cover from 1975 to 1987.

COSSA Slide 373 - 390 ENDEAVOUR PROGRAM Endeavour is the first significant multi-disciplinary indigenous space payloaddesigned and built in Australia since WRESAT was launched in the early 1960's. The Endeavour program was funded by the Australian Space Office (partof the Dept of Industry, Technology & Commerce) and is housed in twocylindrical canisters which are to be mounted on the side of a NASA spaceshuttle cargo bay. The Endeavour payload - a sophisticated space astronomyinstrument - is designed to utilise the NASA Get-Away Special (GAS) concept. This provides an inexpensive means of flying hardware and offers significantadvantages in observation times over rocket mounted payloads. Endeavour is designed to obtain ultraviolet images of violent events innearby galaxies and allow Australian engineers and industry to develop skillsnecessary to design space systems and manufacture space hardware.

COSSA Slide 394 COSSA Slide 395 COSSA Slide 396 Image of oceanic fronts observed during a Westward flight into Marion Bayoff the East coast of Tasmania. Fronts appear on the radar due to the increasedroughness and accumulation of floating debris. Flow convergences at frontsalso cause bunching of waves and wave-breaking. The increased stirringat fronts increases marine productivity and fish oftern accumulate at suchsites. COSSA Slide 397 Image showing possible upwelling site off the Tasmanian coast. Upwellingresults in cooler and generally more nutrient-enriched waters being boughtto the surface resulting in increased biological productivity. The spreadingof upwelled waters results in a stretching out of small-scale waves andhence the slick-like appearance of the surface. Upwelled regions have reducedroughness and show up as dark areas on a black-and-white radar image. Regionseither side of the upwelled region may be sites of convergence and consequentlyhave increased roughness. In this image, swell patterns are visible inthese convergence regions. COSSA Slide's 398 and 399 Image showing the surface signature of internal waves which appear as longthis undulating streaks on the image. Internal waves occur on the continentalshelf expecially during summer when the warm and lighter waters overly coolerand denser water. Internal waves are excited by storms and tides or currentspropagating internal waves approach the coast, they may overturn or breakand cause sporadic mixing of the cooler nutrient rich bottom water withthe nutrient depleted surface waters. It is expensive and difficult tostudy the distribution of internal wave activity by conventional oceanographicinstrumentation. COSSA Slide 400 A colour-enhanced image 40 km wide taken at Macquarie Harbour on the Westcoast of Tasmania during SLAR trials. Visible in the image is an oceanicfront separating turbid water from the harbour and clearer oceanic water. The bright target off the beach in the upper part of the picture is a lightaircraft. Targets just south of Cape Sorell are the Sloop Rocks. The radaris capable of delineating land topographic features and waves braking onthe beach. As well as the front, the radar identifies large-scale wave-likefeatures West of Ocean Beach. COSSA Slide's 401 and 402 Image of streaky fronts and isolated targets due to boats within Storm Baylocated near Hobart. Fronts within Storm Bay occur at sites where the watersfrom the Derwent River and Huon Channel encounter waters from the continentalshelf. The sides of boats are good reflectors of radar waves. Boats producespecular reflection whereby radar waves are directly reflected back as opposedto being scattered back as from a rough surface. COSSA Slide 403 Image of a river plume front emanating from the Wanderer River of WesternTasmania. The plume is visible on the radar image as streaky bands of slickand rough regions in a 3 kilometer wide band along the coast. The streakynature of the plume indicates the nature of mixing processes whereby theriver waters are mixed with the continental shelf waters. COSSA Slide's 404 and 405 An unenhanced image showing the South end of Maria Island and targets dueto fishing boats and schools of fish. Five boats and one fish school canbe identified in the image.

MICROBRIAN PROCESSING OF SLAR DATA COSSA's aquisition of the Ericsson Side Looking Airborne radar (SLAR) resultedin the CSIRO Division of Water Resources being asked to develop applicationsand processing tools for SLAR data within the context of microBRIAN ImageProcessing System. The images represent a summary of the work done so far. Two study sitesare represented. Both occur along the Murray River and contain areas ofthe river system, irrigated and dryland farming as well as a range of vegetationstructures and types. Primarily the work has focused on extracting informationabout the surface medium. For vegetated areas the SLAR will discriminatebetween structural types and canopy moisture levels. In bare areas, variationsin soil surface roughness and moisture content are distinguishable, whileresearch continues into the dielectric effects of soil salinity. COSSA Slide 406 RAW DATA: MURRAY RIVER SOUTH AUSTRALIA. This image represents the starboard view of the flightline. The split screenimage represents a flight line to the NW of Wakool NSW. Signal values represent the relationship between the geometry of the landcoverand the source of the signal, in this case the COSSA aircraft, and the natureof the target surface. The SLAR is configured for X band radar reception and can be used equallyfor maritime or land based projects. Smooth surface covers will reflectlittle or no signal to the antenna and will appear dark while surfaces witha high angle of incidence to the signal appear very bright. X band radaris influenced by surface type, slope, aspect, cover, structure, and moisturestatus. Because of the potenial low surface roughness of water the SLARsignal is compensated to enhance the mid range of data values, the effectcan be seen in the bright strip that runs down the image. Before furtherprocessing this 'gain' effect needs to be removed. The microBRIAN programmSLAR will compute the extent of this trend and generate a new image inwhich the corrected pixel values are written to the third and fourth imagechannel. COSSA Slide 407 REGIONAL TREND The average gain in brightness across each scanline was modeled and importedinto microBRIAN as as 512 pixel by 1 line image. Using mLNRES this singleline image was resampled, in this case to be 480 lines in length. Whendisplayed as a greyscale and reset using the default colour lookup tablein mPIC (option V in mJLAT) the spatial variation in brightness can be seenas colour gradient. COSSA Slide 408 TREND CORRECTED IMAGE (3) Removing the regional trend shows significantly more information withinthe image. Being an airborne scanner the data is effected by the variationsin the flight line and attitude of the plane. In the second of these twoimages horizontal striping and 'flaring' is seen. This is due to pitchand yaw by the aircraft. COSSA Slide's 409, 410 and 411 The CSIRO Division of Water Resources has used the Ericsson Side-LookingAirborne Radar (SLAR) for its projects in the Murrary River region. These images of the Loxton district in South Australia have been colour-enhancedusing MicroBRIAN computer software developed by the Division, to emphasisedifferences in land features. MOS 1/SLAR Registration Work CSIRO Division of Water and Land Resources CANBERRA ACT. COSSA Slide 412 INTEGRATED MOS-1/SLAR IMAGE Simple display of radar as blue, MOS visible green as green, and MOS visiblered as red. The two image were rectified and merged using the microBRIANrectification module mBARRY. The SLAR had a nominal pixel size of 72 metresand was resampled to a 50 metre base. The coregistered data forms the portion of the image with blue tones, theyellow strip that runs down the right hand side of the image contains MOS-1data only. Analysis of the relationship between a MOS-1 derived greenness index (channels4 and 2) and the SLAR show a slight positive correlation most significantover areas of woody vegetation. This is consistent with the SLAR sensitivityto surface roughness. COSSA Slide 413 PRINCIPLE COMPONENT ANALYSIS Display of radar as blue, MOS PC1 as green and MOS PC2 as red. This combinationenables greater interpretive analysis as PC1 represents the brightness inthe MOS data while PC2 is the greenness. Work is continuing to establish the relationships between the SLAR dataand conditions on the ground, specifically moisture status at the time ofthe overpass.

COSSA Slide 438 GLOBAL BIOSPHERE The first truly global view of the Earth's biosphere is seen here. Thecomposite image of the ocean chlorophyll concentration was produced from31,352, 4-km resolution CZCS scenes from November 1978, through June 1981,each of which corresponds to approximately 2 billion square kilometers ofocean surface. Nearly 400 million bytes of raw CZCS data located on morethan 12,000, 9-track computer tapes were used to make this image. Landvegetation patterns are derived from three years of daily images from NOAA-7'svisible and near infrared sensors (credit: C.J. Tucker, NASA/GSFC). COSSA Slide 439 IMAGE COMPOSITING The mosaics of all available CZCS data collected on a given day form thebuilding blocks for all longer-term averages. Where more than one passoverlaps, data for that area are averaged, but the number of passes averagedat any one point on the Earth to form the composite varies greatly. Here,the results of the compositing process can be seen with daily, weekly, monthly,and seasonal composites displayed. Note the increased geographical coverage,and spatial smoothing that occurs as the time-scale increases. COSSA Slide 440 COASTAL FEATURES Pigment distributions off the northeast coast of South America (upper left,Oct. 1979) are dominated by the influence of two great rivers - the Amazonand the Orinoco - which together contribute 20 percent of the global riverdischarge to the ocean. The Orinoco plume extends into the Caribbean, whilethe Amazon plume flows north along the Brazilian coast and then meanderseastward across the Atlantic, influenced by the North Equatorial Countercurrent. The tongue of cold, nutrient-rich water of the Malvinas/Falkland Currentborders on the productive waters at the edge of the Argentinian continentalshelf (upper right, April 1979). The shallow, coastal waters which borderthe Gulf of Mexico (lower left, Oct 1979) support rich fisheries. Oceancurrents flowing past the Maldive Islands off the southern coast of India(lower right, Dec 1979), stimulate plumes of plankton-rich water. COSSA Slide 441 WESTERN BOUNDARY CURRENTS The boundaries of the Gulf Stream off the U.S. East Coast during June 1979(top) and of the Kuroshio Current off Japan during March and April 1979(bottom) are revealed by the color shift between the low pigment watersof the currents and the higher concentrations in adjacent continental shelfor slope waters. Note warm-core rings with low pigment concentration andcold-core rings with higher pigments along the northern and southern GulfStream boundaries, respectively. COSSA Slide 442 INDIAN OCEAN MONSOON Monsoonal variations in the Indian Ocean give rise to seasonal changes inphytoplankton concentrations. Here following a period of pre-monsoon calm(May-June, composite, left), strong summer southwesterly monsoon winds generateupwelling of nutrient-rich waters, leading to the development of bloom conditions(September-October composite, right). COSSA Slide 443 MEDITERRANEAN The relatively clear, pigment-poor waters of the Mediterranean contrastsharply with the plankton-rich Atlantic waters off northwest Spain (upperleft). Clearly evident in this view of the Mediterranean is the well-knownpigment front along southern France and Spain. The image is produced from30 scenes acquired during May 1980. The gyre in the Alboran Sea near theStraits of Gibraltar is caused by complex circulation patterns resultingfrom water exchange between the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean. In somecases localized areas of high production are due to pollution from humanactivities. COSSA Slide 444 POLAR PRODUCTIVITY Highly seasonal phytoplankton blooms characterize these polar waters, wherephotosynthesis is strongly influenced by the availability of light. Notedifferences in Arctic (top) and Antarctic (bottom) summers where the oceanis surrounded by land the land surrounded by ocean, respectively. COSSA Slide 445 UPWELLING DYNAMICS Waters off Peru (left) and northwest Africa (right) are among the most productivein the global ocean. The Peru/Pacific composite covers 16-26 January 1980;the Africa/Atlantic composite 16 and 22 December 1979. Nutrients injectedby wind-driven coastal upwelling result in high phytoplankton biomass andproductivity; this supports some of the world's richest fisheries. Theupwelling is reflected here as 100-km-wide chlorophyll-rich bands alongboth coasts, and plumes of productive waters extending 500 to 1,000 km offshore. Island-induced upwelling generates highly productive regions around theGalapagos Archipelago (left, center). COSSA Slide 446 OCEAN MEANDERS Large meanders associated with the retroflection of the Agulhas Currentas it flows along the eastern coast of Africa are seen in this compositefrom April 1979(top). The equatorial Pacific during December 1979 (bottom)shows the ocean color signature of the cusp-shaped equatorial waves thathave also been observed in sea surface temperature, sea level, and driftingbuoy measurements. COSSA Slide's 447 -450 NORTH ATLANTIC PRODUCTIVITY The annual phytoplankton growth cycle in the North Atlantic basin during1979, begins with the spring bloom at mid-latitudes in the western Atlanticand appears to propagate east and northward as the season progresses, reachinga peak in May and June. Other seasonal features revealed by this time-seriesof images are the offshore movement of the Amazon plume during fall andthe effects of equatorial upwelling in late summer and fall. Note alsothe rich waters of the wind-driven upwelling system off northwest Africa. The strong color signature in the North Sea throughout the year may bemore a result of suspended sediment and dissolved organic substances thanphytoplankton pigment. COSSA Slide 451 OCEAN COLOUR FROM SPACE Text of brochure - See master copy for details. COSSA Slide 452 GLOBAL SEASONAL CHANGE Global phytoplankton concentrations change seasonally, as revealed by thesethree-month composites for 1979: January-March (upper left), April-June(upper right), July-September (lower left), and October-December (lowerright). Note the "blooming" of phytoplankton over the entireNorth Atlantic with advent of northern hemisphere spring, and seasonal increasesin equatorial phytoplankton concentrations in both Atlantic and PacificOceans, and off the western coasts of Africa and Peru. COSSA Slide 453 For the first time, oceanographers now have the ability to view the globaldistribution of photosynthetic organisms in the world's oceans from space. The observations made from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), a radiometerthat operated on NASA's Nimbus-7 satellite from 1978-1986, have sparkeda revolution in the way we think about physical and biological processesin the sea. Using techniques principally developed at the University ofMiami and Goddard Space Flight Center during the past 10 years, color imageshave been produced which show the incredible variability that exists inthe distribution and concentration of phytoplankton - microscopic, single-celledocean plants that provide the ultimate source of food for marine life. The CZCS global data sets scheduled for publication from 1989 onward - examplesof which are contained in the folder - will lay the scientific foundationsfor new generations of satellite ocean color sensors and will form a cornerstonefor international efforts to understand the ocean's role in the global carboncycle.

The system is now widelydistributed throughout Australia and south east Asia (over 80 sites), andcommands a high degree of acceptance and respect by the growing communityof remote sensing researchers and applications specialists. The Remote Sensing Group, together with its commercial partner, MicroprocessorApplications are continuing the maintenance and development of the software. New algorithms are developed for microBRIAN in the course of ongoing researchinto remote sensing theory and applications. COSSA Slide 461 AVHRR Data of South East Australia In 1989 the Division was awarded funding by the Australian Water ResearchAdvisory Council to develop a series of remote sensing baseline maps andprocedures for monitoring aspects of the regional hydrology of the MurrayDarling Basin. The AVHRR scanner with its compliment of visible, NIR, and TIR sensors,its 1100m resolution, and orbital scheduling, makes it well suited for environmentalmonitoring on a synoptic scale. This image has been resampled to conformto a 16 degree grid that bounds the Murray Darling Basin. The visible greensignal is mapped to the green colour gun, the visible red to the blue colourgun and the inverse of the thermal infrared to the red colour gun. Accordinglyareas of vegetation appear green, hot areas red, and cool surfaces blue. COSSA Slide 462 Murray Darling Basin Subcatchment Strings The ability to import ancillary data sets into digital imagery and imageprocessing environment increase the utility and scope of subsequent analysisand interpretation. COSSA Slide 463 Catchment and Coastline strings with 'non basin' pixels removed. COSSA Slide 464 Colour Coded subcatchments embedded in gridded DTM.

COSSA Slide 465 This AVHRR raw data image shows the confluence of the Darling and MurrayRivers and the Menindee and Willandra Lake systems. The orbital frequency of the AVHRR scanner allows for both daytime and nighttimepasses. After correcting for atmospheric effects, it is possible to arriveat reliable estimates of surface temperatures. Moist areas show a lowerthermal difference between day and night and by comparing imagery from bothdatasets over a period of time it is possible to highlight areas which maybe crossreferenced with other data to provide monitoring of changes in groundmoisture levels and possible spread of saline water tables.

The CSIRO Marine Laboratories in Hobart receives data from advanced, veryhigh resolution radiometers on board the NOAA series of satellites, as wellas from meteorological satellites and the Coastal Zone Colour Scanner carriedon NASA's Nimbus 7 spacecraft. In Australia's climate of extremes, it is important to detect patterns inclimate change. Imagery from the NOAA satellite receiver is used to observevariations in vegetation lushness and changes in water status.

LHS: December 1988 - the lakes are totally dry RHS: June 1989 - there is water in Cooper Creek and the bottom half ofLake Eyre - a rare occurrence indeed. The CSIRO Marine Laboratories in Hobart produces images from NOAA satellitedata as coloured maps covering thousands of square kilometres of ocean atone time, showing minute variations in the sea surface temperature. Warmerareas are usually shown in red, with yellow, green and blue indicating progressivelycolder water. In Tasmania, the fishing season usually starts in a swirl of cold waterclose in along the south-east coast. COSSA Slide 484 November 1985: cold waters and a good season. COSSA Slide 485 January 1988: warm waters and the fish have disappeared. COSSA Slide 486 Eastern Tasmania, comparing sea surface temperature and its effect on fisheries. LHS: 1 March 1989 - the jackmackerel fishing season is normally in fullswing off the east coast at about this time. The fish did not appear inthis year as the waters are warm. RHS: 24/25 April - This taken within a week of the first catches of jackmackereloff the east coast - note the cooler blue waters to which the fish havereturned. The CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology has used Landsat imagery in itsanalysis of land degradation in Kakadu National Park (Stage III). Here,soil erosion has occurred and also changes to the vegetation compositionin the drainage lines and wetlands. This is a result of grazing and tramplingby buffalo, made worse by a subsequent invasion of exotic weeds. Models of the erosion process, the interplay of animal behaviour, soil typeand position within the landscape have been developed, substantiated andmapped using Landsat satellite image data. COSSA Slide 487 A wetland (medium-sized back-swamp) that has been drained through channelscut by the concentrated and direct trampling of buffalo. The swamp hasbeen drained into the South Alligator river and now provides a much reducedresource to fauna in the region. COSSA Slide 488 A grassy floodplain showing the scattered, patchy buffalo wallows all orientatedto give shade aginst the hot afternoon sun. COSSA Slide 489 A split pair of false colour images of the Coirwong Creek area comparingthe magnitude and location of the bare and eroded areas (cream-white incolour) and in 1986 and 1988.

Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery provides the CSIRO Division of ExplorationGeoscience with remote sensing data which is used in the mineral explorationindustry to: . improve the process of geological mapping which forms the basis of allexploration . highlight areas that may be associated with mineralisation The Division is also developing image processing techniques to increasethe value of TM imagery in exploration programs. COSSA Slide 497 A false colour composite subscene of Landsat TM imagery in North Queensland. The image is dominated by brightness variations in the terrain that maskthe true reflectance characteristics of surface materials such as vegetation,soils, outcropping rocks and alluvium. COSSA Slide 498 Special processing techniques have been applied to a portion of the sameimage to enhance weak mineralogical signals. The red-orange areas (labelled"A") indicate clays related to hydrothermal alteration, and potentiallygold mineralisation. Green areas indicate the iron-rich sediments of theRobertson River Formation.

COSSA Slide 502 Much of survey and exploration geology is concerned with identifying andrecording on maps the mineral and chemical composition of materials exposedon the earth's surface. Landsat and aircraft Thematic Mapper imagery canprovide efficient and dramatic discrimination of certain lithologies dependingon their brightness, iron oxide and clay mineralogy, vegetative cover, resistanceto erosion, landforms, spatial distribution, etc. Certain remote sensingsystems can provide new, incremental information for the purposes of increasingthe efficiency and objective coverage of increasingly expensive field geology. COSSA Slide's 503 and 504 MINERAL MAPPING SPECIFICATIONS Identification is a hierarchical process largely dependent on resolution. Low (spectral) resolution systems such as the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)permit class identification such as iron oxides, clays and vegetation. Medium resolution systems permit generic mineral identification such asiron oxide, carbonate, A1(OH), Fe(OH) and Mg(OH) mineral groups that inturn allow identification of felsic, mafic and ultramafic rocks. High resolutionsystems permit mineral species identification, such as Alunite, Kaolinite,Sericite, Smectites, Talc, Chlorites, Calcite, and Rare-Earth bearing minerals. Mineral species identification is only possible with instruments specificallydesigned for this purpose. These must have the correct spatial and spectralresolution and, above all, adequate radiometric sensitivity. They mustalso be well calibrated and stabilised on their platform. COSSA Slide 505 GER 64-band scanner spectral band configuration with superimposed dickitespectrum for wavelength comparison. Twenty metre resolution data from thissystem were collected over several sites in Australia in 1987. COSSA Slide 506 Preliminary results from the Coppin Gap region near Marble Bar in northernWestern Australia. The study area straddles both Proterozoic sediments,basalts and porphyries and Archaean greenstone sequences containing felsicand mafic volcanics, ultramafics and granites. COSSA Slide 507 This first level lithological mapping compares favourably with the published1:250,000 scale geology but also indicates scope for regional map updatingin that a number of additional, but un-mapped, formations are evident. Note that this is possible given no 'a priori' knowledge of the geologybecause the spectral characterisation is fairly unique and the images canbe interpreted mineralogically. COSSA Slide 508 At Jarman Well phyrophyllite alteration in the sericitic Hardey Sandstoneadjacent to the chlorite-bearing Kylena basalt has been identified. Thistype of species identification was made from individual and averaged spectralplots (Slide 509) and has been field checked. This previously unrecordedphyrophyllite occurance was originally discovered by imaging spectrometryusing the narrow-swath Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (AIS) and has beenconsiderably extended with the GER instrument. COSSA Slide 509 Smoothed, shortwave infrared, airborne spectra of pyrophyllite and sericitefrom the proterozoic Hardey Sandstone (Pfh) and an unspecified Al(OH) spectrumfrom Archaean rhyolitic lavas (Aal). Note their different shapes and absorptionminima. COSSA Slide 510 Pyrophyllite-like spectra have also been located from two other areas intwo different host lithologies from the Archaean greenstone sequence andawait field-checking. In the Archaean greenstones spectral shapes and absorptionwavelengths indicate Al(OH) and Mg(OH) mineralogy in the form of suspectedPyrophyllite or Alunite, Kaolinite or Smectite, Talc-carbonates, likelyChlorite and Amphibole variously from the flesic lavas, granites, ultramaficsand basalts. COSSA Slide 511 Smoothed, shortwave infrared, airborne spectra from units mapped as talc-carbonatesrocks and peridotites indicating variations in Mg(OH) spectral characteristics.

All the images show adark shadow down the right hand side. This was caused by the SLAR antennawhich was mounted underneath the aircraft within the field of view of thescanner. Almost all the slides are false colour images using three channelsfrom the scanner for red, geen and blue. Usually channels 7,6 and 1 havebeen used for red, green and blue respectively, giving colours similar towhat the eye would see. The altitude of the aircraft determines the widthof the image and the resolution on the ground. All altitudes stated beloware referred to sea level, not terrain clearance. None of the images havebeen corrected for aircraft motion or sampling rate, leading to some geometricdistortions. No atmospheric corrections have been applied. Individual descriptions: COSSA Slide 515 Pittwater area north of Sydney. Altitude 3000m. The numerous dots on thewater in the bottom of the image are moored boats.

COSSA Slide 552 Supernova remnant (SNR) 0540-693 This is a radio image of a supernova remnant, the remains of an explodedstar. (As with all radio images, the colours are false colours). The object is about forty light-years (four hundred million million kilometres)across. In its centre there is a pulsar, a small, dense neutron star rotatingand emitting a burst of radio waves about 20 times a second. The centralbright spot in the image is not the pulsar itself but a region of gas thatis being "fed" with energy by the pulsar; this region is a strongemitter of radio waves. This makes SNR 0540-693 highly unusual. We onlyknow of one other supernova remnant that is energised by a pulsar in thisway. SNR 0540-693 lies in the Large Magellanic Cloud, the galaxy nearest to ours,which is about 170 000 light-years away. Astronomers calculate that weare seeing the supernova remnant about a thousand years after the explosionof the original star (which would have been about twenty-five times moremassive than our Sun). It cannot be seen with an optical telescope as theburst of visible light that must have accompanied the explosion has longsince died away. This radio picture was made from observations taken with the Australia Telescopeover three 12 hour observing sessions in May and June 1990. It is the mostdetailed image so far made of object, which can be viewed only from thesouthern hemisphere. Image: courtesy of CSIRO's Australia Telescope National Facility.

COSSA Slide 656 The Katewice region of Poland is a casualty of acid rain One of the myriad environmental problems being monitored with remote-sensingsatellites. The two images reveal damage to the environment over an eight-yearperiod in the 1980s. Coal burning in this region produces large amountsof sulfur dioxide, which, when combined with water, makes acid rain. Thisprovince covers only 3 percent of Poland, but produces 31 percent of thecountry's coke, 32 percent of its electricity, 52 percent of its steel and98 percent of its coal. Both of these Landsat images were digitally classified,and areas were color-coded to show the degree of vegetation. For both images,blue represents low vegetation, pink is live foliage, green is a middlerange of foliage and orange is a less amount. The image at left has a lotof pink and other colors, indicating dense vegetation and a healthy environment. The image at right is the same area eight years later, showing an extensiveloss of vegetation.

In further analyses and experimental work we hope to relatethese variations in abundance of prawns to either area of mangroves or mangrovecommunity type. The remote sensing analysis could then be extended to widerareas to help understand regional variations in commercial prawn catchesand also to help in habit protection if we find that some mangrove communitiesor areas of mangrove forests are particularly important for prawn production.

ERS-1 First Results and Images The following 3 slides are a selection from the 24-slide ESA - ERS-1 set. ERS-1 works in a 780 km high, polar orbit circling the Earth every 100 minutes. In 3 days it can cover the entire planet. The volume of data producedby ERS-1 is enormous; over one million bits per second just from the "LowBit Rate" sensors and 100 million bits per second from the SyntheticAperture Radar, SAR; the equivalent of 5600 pages of text every second: The "Low Bit Rate" data is stored on board and then dumped asthe satellite passes over three dedicated ground stations. The SAR datais transmitted in realtime. Part of the objective of the mission is to make sure that this continuousstream of data gets to its users as fast as possible. It is preprocessedat Kiruna, in the north of Sweden, and then sent on to users before thesatellite reappears, 100 minutes later, loaded with new data. The Synthetic Aperture Radar, or SAR as it is known, is the most spectacularinstrument onboard ERS-1. Unlike the human eye, radar does not depend uponthe visible wavelengths of light; night or day, the SAR produces high qualityimagery of the surface of the Earth, Water, ice, vegetation, urban areas- these all backscatter radar frequencies at different intensities. Theresolution of the SAR is high enough to produce an image, comparable tothat of an optically produced photograph, but containing much more information. The environmental data coming from the SAR are therefore very considerable- covering many features, ranging from oil pollution on the sea surface,to denuded rainforests. COSSA Slide 676 Thames Estuary, UK The radar on ERS-1 is sensitive to small changes in the roughness of theobject which it is observing and this explains why the water surface takesvarious aspects. Water surface roughness is affected by wind, current and the passage ofobjects. It can also be indirectly influenced by features existing or occurringbeneath the surface ; consequently, it is the surface effect of these submergedfeatures that we see in radar images. In this image we find details relatingto shallow water bathmetry, ships and their wakes, current flow and windeffects. This radar is sensitive not only to roughness but also to water content,target geometry and orientation. Buildings for example are very angularstructures and as a result show up as bright points in radar images. COSSA Slide 677 TIDAL EFFECTS IN MORECAMBE BAY, UK The ease with which ERS-1 SAR images can be co-registered without the needto geometricaly correct each one first, demonstrates the stability of boththe spacecraft and the processing. The example shown here of Morecambe Bay (area of 50 km x 50 km), just tothe north of Blackpool (bottom centre), uses three images, 6 days betweeneach, gathered over the period 1-13 August 1991. Highlighted in the magentacolour are the vast expanses of sandbanks and mud flats within MorecambeBay that are covered by the sea at high tide and then exposed at low tide. Patterns within these areas are due to the various rises, dips and drainagechannels that cross the sand/mud at low tide. This tidal effect can alsobe observed to extend several kilometres inland up the numerous river coursesthat flow into the bay with the low-tide water courses appearing as thisblue lines as you follow the rivers upstream. Using the three-image combination, the coastline is immediately recognisableas the change from the more brightly coloured water and sand/mud areas tothe greyish overall tone of the land masses. Although greyish in overall tone, different colours, especially in the fieldsthat lie between Lancaster and Fleetwood to the south of the bay where harvestingof some crops may have begun, indicate that changes have taken place, evenover the short period covered by these images. Towards the north the beginningsof the hills and mountains of the Lake District can be seen, with the southernend of Lake Windermere appearing in black at the top. On it's shores tothe west the woods of Grizedale Forest appear in pale grey, with other woodedareas appearing as a similar tone elsewhere in the image. With the exception of the hillsides the brightest objects in the image areall man-made, from the major towns of the area to a single very bright pointto the south of Lancaster. Also visible are the thin bright lines of severalrailways, the one round the bay being traceable almost without break. COSSA Slide 678 ISLAND OF OLERON AND GIRONDE ESTUARY FRANCE The image shows an area of the ATLANTIC COAST of FRANCE, between the harbourof LA ROCHELLE (in bright tones, upper left) and the GIRONDE estuary (bottomright). The island of RE is visible (top left) and the island of OLERON(centre left). The image demonstrates the capacity of the SAR of ERS-1 to sense the variousfeatures of the sea surface. The swell (wavelength approx. 130m), clearlyvisible here, rises from the west and moves towards the coastline. At theentrance to the PERTUIS ANTIOCHE, between the two islands, the swell canbe seen to deviate towards the south. Another interesting feature is the swell refraction around the reef of CORDOUAN,at the entrance to the GIRONDE estuary. A black area is visible indicatingcalm water, sheltered from the wind. Some large strips are clearly identifiableacross the estuary. They are probably due to the interaction of currentsbelonging to the river and the ocean. Inland, one can recognise the LANDES forest, between the GIRONDE estuaryand the ocean. The CHARENTE valley can be seen from SAINTES (centre right)to ROCHEFORT, near the coast. COSSA Slide 679 STRAIT OF BONIFACIO FRANCE/ITALY This image covers the southern part of CORSICA and the northern part ofSARDINIA, separated by the STRAIT of BONIFACIO. The neatly delineated coastal profiles, the layout of the small islands,the changing sea conditions and the corrugated inland geometry make theimage quite spectacular. The definition and visibility of the coasts changeaccording to the conditions of the sea, but the small islands of CAVALLOand LAVEZZI are clearly visible, south east of CORSICA. Also the islandsof MADDELENA ARCHIPELAGO are clearly distinguishable: SPARGI, BUDELLI, RAZZOLI,SANTA MARIA, MADDELENA, CAPRERA and SANTO STEFANO and all the smaller islands,north-east of SARDINIA. In CORSICA, the fjord of BONIFACIO can be perceived,on the left of the southern tip of the island. The waters of the fjordare agitated (lighter tone). The different sea and wind conditions are shown in contrast to the areasof calm sea. A strong wind is blowing from NW (20 knots) and in the wholearea the sea is rough; patches of calm sea appear only downwind from SARDINIA(darker stripes in the sea in front of OLBIA). The lighter stripe of waterin front of the town of OLBIA, (the three large white spots on the eastcoast of SARDINIA) represents an area of rough water, raised by the windwhich enters the island from the north coast and is channelled through theOLBIA valley down to the sea. Similar phenomena appear in other downwindcoastal waters of CORSICA and SARDINIA. North of OLBIA, closer to the NE coast, a small bright spot correspondsto the small town of ARZACHENA. Other smaller towns and villages are visibleto the left, inland. Close to the bottom border of the image, on the left,a light grey small surface, uniform and well delimited, in the middle ofthe mountains, corresponds to the lake COGHINAS, with the surface wateragitated by the wind. Left of CORSICA, it is possible to see wavetrainstravelling apparently in the direction NW to SE (wavelength approx. 100m),and change slightly direction in crossing the straits. A spectacular feature are the four large waves (wavelength approx. 3km)to the east of the strait. COSSA Slide 680 WIERINGERMEER POLDER THE NETHERLANDS This colour image is a combination of three black and white images acquiredat 3-day intervals over the Wieringermeer polder in North Holland. Thearea extends 25 km x 25 km and is located between the North Sea (top left),the Ijsselmeer (bottom right) and the Waddenzee (upper part of the image). The colour variations over the sea are due to changes in the state of thewater's surface. The small black area which separates the Waddenzee fromthe little Amstelmeer (near the centre of the image) corresponds to sandbanksprotruding out of the water. The Weiringermeer polder, an area of reclaimed land, can be distinguishedby its regular pattern of large agricultural fields and drainage canals(centre and right of the image). The old island of Wieringen, which isnow rejoined to the mainland, is visible as a dark area to the north ofthe Wieringermeer polder. From here is the beginning of the Afsluitdijk,a long dike separating the Ijsselmeer from the Waddenzee. The dark areas to the bottom left of the image correspond mainly to meadowfields around the city of Schagen, which appears as very brightly coloured. The variations in colour of the agricultural fields are mainly due to changesin the humidity of the soil and vegetation. COSSA Slide 681 IBIZA & FORMENTERA SPAIN The Islands of Ibiza and Formentera belong to the Balearic Islands (WesternGroup). Ibiza's rocky and jagged coast noticeably stands out from a rough sea, especiallyin the Western area, from where it received illumination, the mountains,showing the typical SAR folding effect, can be clearly depicted in the Centreand North-Eastern parts of the island. The shadows on the sea indicatea wind blowing from the South West. Ibiza's town and harbour are shown in very bright return. The lagoons inboth Ibiza and Formentera show in dark which indicates a flat surface. Some interesting patterns are also shown over the sea surface, especiallyin the North East of the island, where a wave system appears to be travellingfrom the West.

COSSA Slide 714 RIFT VALLEY, KENYA Scene 137-351, image acquired on March 14, 1986, XS mode, level 1B preprocessing. Sub-scene covering 10 km x 10 km. Note the characteristic shapes of the deforested areas in this portion ofthe Rift Valley near Nakuru, Kenya. Under the pressure of farmers in searchof new land, deforestation follows the valleys upstream (pale pink areas). The only stretch in native forest is in the NE of the image (in dark red). Note the isolated trees that are occasionally spared. At the time of yearwhen this image was recorded, the crops had not yet covered the ground,so fields appear in black, white and grey. COSSA Slide 715 FOREST FIRES, S-E FRANCE Scene 054-262, image acquired on August 3, 1986, XS mode, level 1B preprocessing. Sub-scene covering 10 km x 10 km. Recently burnt out areas appear dark blue, areas burnt out some time agoin light blue, and intact vegetation in red. In this region, tracts ofMediterranean forest and scrub are burnt out every year. The fires spreadquickly partly because of the uncleared undergrowth and scrub which growsabundantly. One reason the forests are uncleared is that farming, includingforest grazing, has given way to an entirely tourism-based economy. COSSA Slide 716 CHERNOBYL, UKRAINE, U.S.S.R.

COSSA Slide 718 'ADORATION OF THE MAGI' One scene in a fresco cycle, painted by the Florentine master Giotto dibondone. The cycle decorates the interior of the Scrovengni chapel in Paduaand was probably begun in 1303. Halley's Comet appeared in 1301 and servedas a model for Giotto's Star of Bethlehem'. ESA named its mission to Halley'sComet 'Giotto' in recognition of the fact that Giotto di bondone made thefirst 'scientific' drawing of the comet recorded in history. COSSA SLIDE 719 HALLEY'S COMET Reproduction of one of the original plates of Comet Hallet taken on 25 May1910 at Helwan, egypt.

COSSA SLIDE 720 COMET HALLEY Comet Halley on 19 May, 1910 photographed at the Lowell Observatory. Theoriginal photographic plate was digitised at he Kitt Peak National Observatoryand colours were added with an image display processor. The comet had paddedthrough perihelion one month earlier and was at a distance of 0.9AU fromthe sun and 0.3 AU from the Earth. (Slide courtesty of Lowell Observatoryand the National Optical Astronomy Observatories). COSSA SLIDE 721 RECOVERY OF P/HALLEY 1982i Recovery of P/Halley 1982i on 16 October 1982 by astronomers D.C. Jewittand G.E. Danielson, using the 5.1m Mount Palomar telescope and a CCD electroniccamera. The comet was identified by its motion of 3.5arc seconds per houragainst the star background, by its position which was withihn 8 arc secondsfrom the position predicted for it by D. Yeomans and by its visula magnitudeof 24.2 (23.1 predicted). The comet is shown in the centre of the circle. For comparison, the bigblack spot vertically aboce it is a star of magnitude 21. At the time ofthe recovery halley was 11 AU away from the sun. COSSA SLIDE 722 ARTIST'S CONCEPT OF A COMETARY NUCLEUS Artist's concept of a cometary nucleus. The nucleus is presumed to be abody of a few kilometers in diameter (not necessarily round) consistingmostly of water ice with dust mixed in. On approaching the Sun the nucleusis heated up and releases enormous amounts of dust and gas(a few tons persecond), preferentially from the sunward side(slide courtesy of JPL). COSSA SLIDE 723 GIOTTA SPACECRAFT The left half shows the outside of the spacecraft, the right half givesa cross sectional view. The spacecraft is cylindrical in shape. Duringflight it is spin-stabilised, nominally at 15rpm. During the encounterthe spacecraft spin axis is aligned with thte relative velocity vector suchthat cometary dust and gas particles impact the spacecraft from below. The directions to the Earth and the Sun are representative for the encounter. COSSA SLIDE 724 GIOTTO EXPERIMENTS Nearly all experiments are mounted on the lowest of three platforms, the'experiment platform'. Ther are 10 experiments on Giotto which can be looselygrouped in four categories: Imaging(blue) HMX - Halley Multicolout Camera Gas Mass Spectroscopy (yellow) NMS - Neutral Mass Spectrometer IMS - Ion Mass Spectrometer (consists of HERS - High Energy range Spectrometerand HIS - High Intensity Spectrometer) Dust Experiments (violet) PIA - Particulate Impact Analyser (Dust Mass Spectrometer) DID - Dust Impact Detection System OPE - Optical Probe Experiment (also measures gaseous emissions) Plasma Experiments (green) JPA - Johnstone Plasma Analyser (consists of FIS - Fast Ion Sensor and IIS- Implanted Ion Sensor RPA - Reme Plasma Analyser ( consists of EESA - Electron Electrostatic Analyserand PICCA - Positive Ion Cluster Composition Analyser) EPA - Energetic Particles MAG - Magnetometer COSSA SLIDE 725 GIOTTO SPACECRAFT Giotto spacecraft during integration in the Intespace facility in Toulouse:Shown on the experiment platform from right to left: camera (white, lookingdown), star mapper (red, looking up), EPA with its three very small telescopes,NMS (red plate), two hydrazine jets used for orbit and attitude control,IIS of the JPA experiment and on the left edge HERS of the IMS experiment. The silver spheres on the main platform are two of the four hydrazine tanks. COSSA SLIDE 726 GIOTTO SPACECRAFT Giotto spacecraft half enclosed by the solar cell array. Shown on the experimentplatform from left to right: starmapper, camera, checkout panel, PICCA ofthe RPA experiemtn (white, looking down), EESA of the RPA experiment (whitewith a rep cap), PIA (Black,only a small part shown). COSSA SLIDE 727 GIOTTO SPACECRAFT Giotto spacecraft completely enclosed by the solar cell array and the blackMLI (multilayer insulation) blankets around the experiment platform. Therectangular plate between the starmapper and the camera consists of OSRs(many small optical solar reflectors, each 2x4 cm), the square plate tothe right of the camera is a thermal shutter (Kapton foil with gold coasting). The spacecraft is being prepared for the solar simulation test in the mainvacuum chamber of the Intespace facility in Toulouse. It is connected tothe test adaptor (bottom) by 12 bars, which thermally isolate the spacecraftfrom the adaptor. A cable loom (right hand side) connects the spacecraftcheckout panel with the control room during the test. COSSA SLIDE 728 GIOTTO SPACECRAFT DURING THE SOLAR SIMULATION TEST Giotto spacecraft during the solar simulation test. During the test thespacecraft was spinning at 10 rpm. The solar radiation was simulated by36 lamps with a total power that varied form 1250 to 1800Watts/m2 and anaspect angle that varied from 35' to 130' to simulate the effect of theSun on the spacecraft during the various phases of the mission for verificationof the thermal model. COSSA SLIDE 729 ARIANE 1 ROCKET Giotto will be launched by an Ariane 1 rocket from Kourou, French Guyana. (The slide shows the launch of another spacecraft). On the left hand sideis the service tower which has been withdrawn from the rocket. The launchwindow opens at the end of June and closes in mid August, and averages onehour per day. The nominal launch date is 2 July 1985. COSSA SLIDE 730 ARIANE 1 ROCKET The Ariane 1 rocket places the Giotto spacecraft in a geostationary transferorbit (nomical parameters, perigee: 200 km, apogee: 36 000km, inclination:10', period: 10.5 hours). AOS MAL refers to acquisition of signal by theMalindi ground staiton in Kenya, LOS - loss of signal, CAR refers to theCarnarvon ground station in Australia. After nominally 3 revolutions inthe GTO the onboard solid propellant boost motor is fired close to perigee(before firing the spacecraft will be spun up from 15rpm to 90 rpm) to injectthe spacecraft into the heliocentric transfer trajectory. This will bethe first time that an ESA spacecraft reaches interplanetary space. COSSA SLIDE 731 GIOTTO GROUND STATIONS During its cruise phase the Giotta spacecraft is controlled by a nuber ofground stations distributed over the Earth. Depending on their size andequipment the ground stations are used for different purposes and differentmission phases. COSSA SLIDE 732 SPACECRAFT ATTITUDE CONSTRAINTS DURING CRUISE Spacecraft attitude constraints during cruise. Throughout the mission thespacecraft attidtude defined by the sun aspect angle(0' - Sun above thetripod) must be kept inside an allowed corridor (light yellow) which isgiven by two contraints: The high gain antenna must permanently point atthe Earth to maintain the telecommunications link (communications constraint,green line), and, secondly, the spacecraft must generate enough power withoutbeing heated up too much (thermal/power constraints,red line). The 'hotphase' of the mission occurs at the end of December 1985 when Giotto is0.72 AU away from the Sun. In the event that the telecommunications linkto the Earth is lost the spacecraft will slowly drift out of the allowedcorridot. If, however. the attitide is kept within a certain narrow partof the alloed corridot (dark yellow), its boundaries given by the 'shearedconstraint', Giotto could be up to 12 days without contact and still remainin the allowed corridor. The nominal attitude strategy (blue line) is continuouslyin the dark yellow part of the corridor and is based on minimum hydrazineconsumption during the cruise phase. In this sense it is an optimal strategyfrom which one must deviate during the last few days of the cruise to arriveat the comet with the required Sun aspect angle of 107'. COSSA SLIDE 733 GIOTTO ENCOUNTERS HALLEY'S COMET 8 months after launch the Giotto spacecraft (blu curve) encounters halley'sComet (yellow curve). The encounter occurs around 00 UT on 14 March 1986,about one month after the comet's perihelion passage. At the time of theencounter the Sun is 0.89 AU away, the earth (green curve) is 0.98 AU way. Halley's orbit is retrograde, i.e. its orbit sense is opposite to thatof the Earth and the spacecraft and, therefore, the flyby velocity is veryhigh. COSSA SLIDE 732 GIOTTO Schematic of the encounter geometry. Giotto will be targeted to pass thenucleus a few hundred, nominally 500, kilometres on the sunward side. Thespacecraft will enter the visual coma about an hour before the time of closeestapproach. The sizes shown are not to scale. The nucleus is only a fewkilometres in diameter, a contact surface separating the cometary ions fromthe disturbed solar-wind/comet interaction region is exepcted at 1000 km,a bow shock at 105-106 km. The bumper shield at the bottom of the spacecraftwill protect it from destruction by dust particles impacting at the flybyvelocity of 68.7 km/s. It is estimated that the probability fro survivingthe flyby is >90%. COSSA SLIDE 735 GIOTTO SPACECRAFT APPROACHING HALLEY'S COMET The Giotto spacecraft approaching Halley's Comet. The comet is a paintingafter the Mt. wilson Observatory photograph taken of Halley's Comet on 8May 1910. COSSA SLIDE 736 GIOTTO SPACECRAFT TARGETING About 2 days before the encounter a final decision will have to be madewhere to target the Giotto spacecraft. Unfortunately, the position of thecomet nucleus can only be estimated because the nucleus is disguised buthe coma dust and gad. Based on observations fromthe Earth the nucleusposition is known with an accuracy of 500 km. If the spacecraft is targetedat 500 km the actual flyby distance could be anywhere between 0 and 1000km or more. This is not a very satisfactory situation. The two Soviet Vega spacecraft (only one shown) encounter Halley's Comet7 and 4 days before Giotta and their onboard cameras will observe the nucleusfrom a distance of 10 000km. The Soviets have agreed to provide ESA withthe nucleus positions as derived from their camera images to enable Giottato be targeted more precisely. NASA supports this so-called 'PathfinderConcept' by tracking the Vega spacecraft using precise L-Band Very LongBaseline Interferometry (VLBI) navigation techniques. This reduces theVega orbit uncertainty from a few hundred to about 40 km. Thanks to theThree-Agency-Pathfinder-Agreement the giotto targeting undertainty is reducedfrom 500 to 130 km. COSSA SLIDE 737 EUROPEAN SPACE OPERATIONS CENTRE (ESOC) Main Control Room at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt,w.Germay. This room will be used during the encounter to track and operatethe spacecraft and monitor its health. During the encounter science dataare transmitted from Giotto to the 64 m round station at Parkes, NSW, Australiaat a rate of 40 kbps. The station is owmned by the Australian CSIRO Institute. The data are transmitted at full rate in real time via 8 lines to ESOCwhere they are separated for the various experiments, processed and displayedon VDUs(Visual Display Units) for preliminary analysis.

The document sequence is by Classification on a purpose-designed scheme,derived by John Prytz of the Australian Parliamentary Library, and modifiedby Marcia Kingwell. There are 17 major categories,(each beginning with a letter of the alphabet) and the sub-divisions areshown at the beginning of each group. A document classification consists of two alphabetic subject letters, followedby a numerical aspect number (between 1 and 16); a hyphen (-), followedby a numerical geographic qualifier number between 00 and 96. The classificationis of the form AAxx-xx; it gives the shelf location. Each item is uniquely identified by a sequential acquisition number, givingthe year in which the item was catalogued. Acquisition numbers have theform 19xx.xxxx. This catalogue has an entry for each volume/item in COSSA library. The entryfor each item begins with the symbol "@" , and terminates witha carriage return. The entry identifies the title, authors, subject matter,publication date, shelf location (classification); comments and unique identifier(the acquisition number, in the final or "Other data" field).See below.

Arrange for transfer to a suitable working medium such as 8 mm tape,of full disk GMS time series data for a benchmark period of at least 12months (nominally 1 July 1994-30 June 1995). 2. Determine best practice approach to calibration, cloud identification,and navigation of the benchmark data. This may involve use of data fromthe "CIGSN" satellite calibration network (Prata et al,1995). 3. Determine range of science data products to be derived from benchmarkdata set. Mandatory products are metadata, and digital quick look files.Other products may include, for example, albedo, photosynthetically activeradiation, net solar radiation, SST, water vapour (GMS5); time lapse movieloops; or examples of machine pattern recognition searches. 4. Determine best means of making data sets widely available (eg networkaccess). This may involve consideration of public domain tools such as EosDISInformation Management System, or other means of data set visualisation,browsing and request; and the availability of suitable communication andmass storage facilities. 5. Carry out quantitative comparisons of GMS Pathfinder products with thosefrom comparable activities (eg GOES data of geographic area covered by bothsensors; products currently used by BoM, JAM). 6. Determine stability of radiometric calibration and navigation of GMSdata over the benchmark period. 7. Observe conditions of Bureau of Meteorology/Japan Meteorological Agencyagreement in relation to GMS; and advise on any steps necessary to facilitatedistribution of GMS Pathfinder data products consistent with this agreement.WT03-B25-277IA029-000311-B013-24http://gaia.cossa.csiro.au:80/spin69/spin691.htm 138.44.40.1 19970114161556 text/html 1867HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Tue, 14 Jan 1997 16:14:14 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Wed, 10 Jul 1996 23:51:25 GMTContent-length: 1693 SpIN no. 69 Number 69, April 1996 ISSN: 1037 - 5759 About SpIN In this issue ...

See list 1. Introductions Hosts Russian Space Agency.* and Hydrological/Meteorological Service, Roshydromet*,gave greetings. Chair (H Wood), Vice Chairs (H Kikuchi, G Szejwach), gave brief welcomes.Jeff Kingwell did likewise, on behalf of CEOS Chair. * Dr Y Milov, deputy director of RSA, gave this address. + Dr S Avdjushin, of Roshydromet gave this address. Attending were many Russian and Ukrainian user agencies - Fisheries, Forests,Oceans, Disaster Management, and others. Refer Document 1, 2 for meeting agenda and information. 2. WGINS This was a final summary of the interim Working Group on International NetworkServices, which is now subsumed in WGISS. The presentation was made by HiroshiKikuchi. Group Emphasised · coherent top down strategy · project/target oriented activities giving visible evidence of progress,value of investment · user driven, client oriented Noted that CSIRO's network demonstrator proposal is consistent with theseconcepts. S. Sobue reported on the "Yellow Pages for On-line Services" concept. (see Document 18) This is a directory of EO on-line resources. Initially, NASA/DLR/NASDA havecontributed to print version; on-line version is being developed. 3. WGD As for WGINS, this was last report, since WGD is now subsumed in WGISS. 3.1 CEOS Information Systems Luigi Fusco presented plans for next 1-2 years, including; -encouraging, and providing technical support, for members' entries (dittoaffiliates such as IGBP). -upgrading Dossiers via Task Team work. 3.2 Purge Alert Levin Lauritson - CEOS Infor Sys home page so organisation can registerwith and post messages to Purge Alert Bulletin Board. This gives internationalEO community the chance to 'rescue' any data no longer required by the custodian. Action 1 CSIRO EOC to register (currently only open to members of WGISS) Action 2 COSSA to bring to attention of CSDC co-ordinating sub-committee Refer Document 11. 3.3 CCSDS Archive Meeting Report (Co-ordinating Committee on Space DataSystems) Wyn Cudlip reported on the 'digital archive model" developed at thismeeting. Refer Document 7. Action 3 COSSA to Report on the meeting conclusions to CSDC co-ordinating subcommitee. I noted adoption of the high-level concepts such as self-describing archivegranules; use of special languages (eg PVL); and standard granule structure(Standard Formatted Data Unit) in the CSIRO/BOM project on Australian HRPTarchive standard, carried out by Peter Turner. This would be a good casestudy for CCSDS. Action 4 COSSA to offer to report on HRPT archive standard at CSDC. 3.4 World Data Centres Conference Martha Maiden gave an intersting description of the ICSU-sponsored WorldData Centres meeting, at which she gave a presentation on CEOS IDN. TheWDCs are re-examining their role as they emerge from Cold War context. Theydecided to add WDC home pages to one or all of: - NASA Master Directory (NB this is more extensive than GCMD, includes spacescience data) - CIESIN - CEOS IDN/CEOS Information Systems. Refer Document 31 4. Sub-group reports NOTE The WGISS structure is not yet finalised. For the time being, the formersub-groups of WGD are continuing, but they are not formally 'WGISS' subgroupsyet. 4.1 Catalog Sub-group (CS) George Saxton reported that CS is organised as 6 task teams; (Refer Document5) i). International Directory Network (IDN), led by Lola Olsen of NASA. TheIDN now comprises 4 co-ordinating nodes (NASA, NASDA, ESA, UNEP/GRID), 10co-operating nodes and 5 future nodes Australia plus Brazil, China, NewZealand and Russia. CEOS Inventory; ii). CEOS Inventory Interoperabilty Experiment (CINTEX), led by DLR, servesas an international test bed for catalog interoperabilty techniques andprotocols. Meets by telecom monthly. (CINTEX) interacts with IDN, to investigate IDN/CINTEXinteroperablility. Eumetsat, Spot Image and EurImage are now members. It is merging IMS with ESU-UIT as it becomes more operational ("CINTOP"). Fusco demanded a stronger user evaluation of CINTEX. CINTEX still depends on protocol bridges eg between IMS and UIT, so a useris tricked into thinking they are the same. Many of the protocols supporting CINTEX (CINTOP will themselves change (egIMS V.0). Although CINTEX/CINTOP is vital for expanding present day communication,there is a need to develop a unified high level protocol for new internationallyinteroperable catalog and access systems for EO data. This is done by ProtocolDefinition Task Team (see below) iii). Protocol Definition Task Team This is specifically a Catalogue Interoperabliltiy Protocol (CIP), of whichVersion A will be available December 1995 (inventory search). A VersionB (protocol definition including browse, data product ordering, securityand user authentication), will be available June 1996. iv.) World Wide Web Task Team A new team, led by Yoon Sook Enloe at Goddard. It coordinates implementationof WWW access to international Earth Science data systems. Holds monthlytelecons. This activity is highly relevant to the CSIRO Earth ObservationCentre, as it establishes its Web data system. Note that Luigi Fusco (ESA)very critical of avoidance of Hyper-G as the WWW language/search tool, inthe WWW Task Teams. Action - Flag "Birds of a feather" remote sensing sessionat Fifth WWW Conference, Paris, May 1996 v). Browse Task Team This will be led by NASDA. The team is testing 3 client server models forBrowse interoperability and will present results of this comparision, asa component of the CIP (Catalogue Interoperability Protocol) User RequirementsDocument. vi). Guidelines Task Team Led by BNSC, this group is reviewing Catologue subgroup "guidelines"document on Internationally Interoperable Catalogue Systems. Next meetings of CS; a). CS16 with all four subgroups (and probably WGISS 2), Hatoyama, lateMay 1996, including 4th CINTEX/Protocol Workshop. Action Kingwell to arrange: A). appointment of CSIRO Project Manager for Plenary Demonstrators in timefor PM to plan Plenary Demonstrators Task Team meeting at Hatoyama in May B). CSIRO EOC to arrange adequate participation at Hatoyama. Suggest invitationto P. Turner (FS/HRPT archive), M Wilson (CS/WWW/CINTEX): and Plenary Demo.Project Manager (CINTEX/Protocol and special Task Team meeting). (b). CS17 tentatively September 96 at Sioux Falls. (c). CS18 tentatively April 97 at Toulouse. 4.2 Networks Sub group (NS) Kohei Arai reported. Professor Arai (Saga University) has been appointedas a NASDA Project Scientist, to assist in chairing the NS. Agencies have raised concern about Network security. The subgroup has prepareda guidelines document, available on web. Either there was no written report or I didn't get one: Action Kingwell to check on NS written report, with Kohei Arai. Security guidelines URL; msipo.nasa.gos or v.pub/security/.docs. (I tried this; it is not a correctURL) Action Advise CSDC of the CEOS Network Security document. Comment NS may become an appropriate "host group" for thePlenary Demonstrator, if one is required. Kikuchi expressed - support for ESCAP network feasibility study 1995 ('ESINAP') based on Kingwellet al pre-feasibility study, 1995 - support for Arai as NASDA project scientist and co-chair of NS. 4.3 Auxiliary Data subgroup Refer Documents 3,4 Gunther Schreier summarised: -IDN/DIF structure for auxiliary datasets -Reviewed DIF keywords, CIESIN activity Glossary 1-km AVHRR Future activity in greenhouse sources & sinks Globe 1 km DEM. Map projections (new task team to review status of current map projectionsfor EO, and innovative approaches). ADS Reference Document (refer Document 12 for this valuable summaryof auxiliary data sets being used with Earth Observation data products). Action - Table at CSDC - Suggest NRIC/ERIN/AUSLIG involvement in supply of information. - Provide feedback to ADS by 3/12/95 After December, document will go into CEOS InfoSys. This is Volume 1 ofADC documentation. Volume II is "Guidelines & Recommendations".This will be released for review at WGISS 2 (May 96, Japan) Note WGISS 3will be 2 October 1996 (Germany). On map projections, Schreier made the point that these have been devisedfor displaying data for the human viewer. However we require for EO datamore than 2 D representation:- - 3 Spatial dimensions - temporal dimension - polarimetric, spectral dimensions Approach is to choose whether:- - to develop 'ideal' mapping schema for spherical projection - recommend existing 'standard' for 2D spherical projection - develop 'on demand mapping' approach (append enough navigation informationto EO products to allow computers to supply to any nominated projection.Document 3 discusses this further; the concept of 'on the fly' processingof raw data retained in 'native space' seems to be preferred by many onADS). See also reference to SPICE geolocation tool (P5-6). The projection task force is joint ADS/FS. It will develop specification,public domain software to implement projection task team members welcome.Meeting proposed around Jan/Feb 1996 in Huntsville USA or Munich. Contactis Gunther Schreier. Further discussion will take place in Hatoyama meeting,May 1996. Proposed new ADS Web Project "Earth on Line". This is a "Yellow Pages" for on-line services in reverse; lists auxiliary data sets according to discipline (eg atmosphere models;DEMS) and wraps them in a coherent access model. To be conducted with WWWTask Team of CS. Covered CEC project to define a set of global products building upon theGlobal I Km AVHRR land data project. These include 16 parameter land classification; population density, others. Globe Global Land One km Base Elevation Established global 1km land surface digital elevation model. Based in part on Defence Mapping Agency data recently released, partly asa result of this project. Future Space Shuttle mission will help. Schreiernoted recent agreement with Australian (AUSLIG?) on royalty-free accessto 1 km resolution elevation data for local area. The sub-group is consideringa complementory 1 km global ocean bathymetric data project. CIESIN developments include nomination as a World Data Center A for HumanInteractions in the Environment (CIESIN browser is on IDN). Also CHARLOTTE(http://Sedac.ciesin. org/sedac - 2.3/mvas.home/mvas-home.html) for generatinghtml pages on the fly. Other CIESIN data sets (1 km population, for examplemay be of interest to many.) 5. Demonstration Projects Helen commented that she has introduced this new agenda concept to makesure WGISS stays active and informed. 5.1 Ocean Color a). Peter Churchill spoke on ISPRA/JRC project to compile, on one server,information on ocean color instruments, missions, experiments, and validation.Member input is encouraged. b). John Withrow (IOC) spoke about new IOC proposal (previously discussedwith CSIRO and others) to conduct pilot project like the 1 km AVHRR LandData project, to map either globally or on regional basis to areas of oceanproductivity. Refer Document 21. This benefits from CZCS experience,viz; · improved spectral coverage, sensitivity, leading to improved finalproducts. · improved data validation in coastal and optically complex waters. · better software tools, algorithms and data distribution. 5.2. CEOS Plenary Network Demonstrator Jeff Kingwell (CSIRO) spoke on network (real time data: real time QL; realtime catalogue interoperability) demonstrator plan for 10th CEOS Plenary,November 1996. Refer Document 38, 40. The idea was strongly supported (Fisco, Lauritson, Saxton, Kikuchi). Action - CSIRO to select Project Manager. Task Team to be selected,meet at Hatoyama/Tokyo in May 1996. NASDA has agreed to cover participantstravel costs, and data transfer costs from Japan to Canberra. 5.3 CSIRO CD ROM training package a). Kingwell gave an explanation of the Earth Observation training packageof case studies and data sets for schools and developing countries. ReferDocument 39. There was an extremely enthusiastic response from Asia-Pacific agencies,with the State Meteorological Administration (Professor Xu) particularlysupportive and anxious to participate . Fire monitoring: earthquake prediction,in particular, would be excellent case studies. Dr Fusco suggested including the CEOS InfoSys in toto, as a reference setof EO contacts, dictionary etc. This seems a great idea. (Volume "afew Mb".) Levin Lauritson volunteered a GOES movie loop (Carribean Hurricanes), hopefullywith commentary /class activity suggestions. Note CSIRO would also try to include the Victorian Geography Teacher'sAssociation lesson material based on "AusWatch". Gunther Schreier (DLR), although somewhat critical of concept not goingfar enough (of the "Information Locator Service"), suggested thatJean-Paul Malingreau's work on a TREES CD could be included in part. Alan Haskell (DRA) provided reference documents for ERS (refer Document16, 17). These can be included (Kingwell has to write to Haskell acknowledgingour agreement). This would cross-reference with any ERS data extracted fromlatest ESA CD. Action MAW/JK/Smith Systems to follow up these sources. Note: The case studies (ICE classification, oil exploration) seen at NPOwould be excellent CD case studies 6. WGISS 5 Year Plan Alan Haskell led initial discussion. Plan is a compromise between desirefor strategic thinking ('top down" approach), and practical considerations,such as fact that sub group projects , and all CEOS work, is voluntary.This means in practice that people are inclined to do what they are interestedin, not what needs to be done. Participants broke into small drafting/discussion groups, initially to examinework prackages, then to consider specific projects. Several things emerged; · how to emphasise 'service view' through enhanced and broader clientconsultation, more network tools (eg locators). · how to interact with other extensive data networks, such as GTS andits future enhancements. · is the 'work package' approach valid for a best efforts organisationIt was derived in context of managing consultants or work teams. · several areas need more emphasis; real time data; co-ordination ofground station operations, for instance. · plan should show the big picture, not just detail A writing committee (Ward, Haskell, Mather, Kingwell, Wolf, Fusco, Lauritson)was asked to prepare version 0.3, based on inputs from the meeting. 7. Technical Tour of NPO Planeta Planeta is part of the Russian Hydrological and Meteorological Service,Roshydromet, responsible for designing, building and operating meteorologicalsatellite sensors. Planeta employs about 600 people in at least 3 sites;Moscow and ground stations north of Moscow and Novosibisk. It receives datafrom GOMS (geostationary satellite over Indian Ocean), Resource, NOAA, andthe Russian/Ukrainian real aperture Okean 1 & 2. Planeta co-operates with NASA (TOMS ozone instrument on Meteor); DLR (integratingPlaneta data catalogue on ISIS system); ESA (ERS reception planned); SPOT(SPOT reception planned; and the Russian Space Agency, which contracts (co-funds)the organisation as part of the national space program. GOMS appears to be operating nominally, with hourly data received. Theseand other satellite data, are sent by modem to various institutions. Someinformation is distributed over the GTS directly from Planeta. In the software and applications development laboratory, projects demonstratedincluded ice monitoring for ice breaker operations; oil exploration; landcover type and classification.(Any of these would be ideal for the CSIROCD ROM). The first uses Okean radar and passive microwave. Ice analysis based onthese are transmitted by satellite to ice breakers in both polar areas. The second used Resource data over Siberia to look for hydrocarbon seepage.The third used a variety of satellite data (Resource, NOAA, others). Planeta has developed a PC(DOS) based catalogue system which can be accessedby external users. It gives a simple screen (similar to ISIS, IMS, MUIS)which allows a search by date, acquisition site, satellite/sensor, geographiclocation, or polygon. The system was established over the last three years. The systems shows details of frames + intersecting the search area, includingnumerical cloud cover. It also shows in graphic form the extent of overlap,allowing for sensor geometry. Planeta are building an interface between their catalogue and the Unix basedISIS, using equipment provided by DARA (comprising the first Unix systemat Planeta). The overall impression was that of a highly capable and motivated group,successfully operating a wide variety of satellite data systems in adverseeconomic circumstances, and somewhat limited computing facilities. + Because the orbits of Russian satellites can be less regular than, say,Landsat and SPOT, the Russians define data granules by 'frames' rather that'scenes'. Frames are defined by segmenting each orbit - on successive orbits,frame dimensions may vary. J Kingwell CEOS Point of Contact/ WGISS member November 1995 Documents 1.

This includes about 25 Projects in the areas of data management,network operations, standards, formats, user tools/ services, in relationto Earth observation and auxiliary data sets. The first two tasks in the 5 year plan are led by CSIRO: i) CD-ROM for educational organisations and developing countries and ii) Network Demonstration showing real time and archived satellite dataand products, to be conducted at the time of the CEOS Plenary in Canberra,13-15 November 1996. Other Projects of topical interest include an Information Locator Service,aimed at increasing the ability of developing countries to log their owndata, and access that of others; global mapping projections suitable forcomputer visualisation; metadata standards; natural disaster fast reaction;network architecture; and yellow pages guide to Data Centres. Further detailsare in project summaries contained in the Plan, which will be presentedto the CEOS Plenary for formal endorsement in November. Former sub-groups of i) WG on Data and ii) interim WG on Networks were mappedonto a new structure, as follows: "Catalogues" becomes "Access", concentrating onstandards and tools which increase the ability of users to access informationand services. The chair is Terry Fisher of CCRS, vice is Dr Luigi Fuscoof ESA. "Networks" and WGN becomes "Networks", concentratingon infrastructure, security and performance measure. Chair is Dick desJardinsof NASA, vice is Professor Kohei Arai, Saga University/NASDA. "Formats" and "Auxiliary Data Sets" become "Data",emphasising interuse of data by ensuring compatibility of data content,format and data application tools (including ingest, processing, integrationtools). Chair is Gunther Schreier (DARA/DLR/CEC) and vice is Wyn Cudlip,UK Defence Research Agency. A User Panel has also been established, with the interim leader Dr GerardSzejwach. This panel will reinforce the WG's strong client-oriented approach. The meetings were held in conjunction with a number of events, includingsub-group meetings; a special interest meeting on the ESCAP "EarthSpace Information Network for Asia and the Pacific" and its possibleconnection with the APEC "Information Infrastructure Initiative";a Project Team meeting, chaired by CSIRO, on the Network Demonstration;and a meeting on the US/Japan "Global Observation Information Network",GOIN. Meetings were hosted by the National Space Development Agency of Japan,in their new Earth Observation Research Centre, Roppongi. The EORC is anew NASDA initiative designed to increase the usefulness and take-up rateof EO data from NASDA missions. Its budget is approximately $50 million.The Centre will host research by Japanese and foreign scientists. Further details: refer to "Reports" section of CSIRO Office ofSpace Science & Applications/Earth Observation Centre Home Page, www.eoc.csiro.au- or contact Mr Jeff Kingwell, jeffk@eoc.csiro.au /GPO Box 3023, CanberraACT 2601 Attendance About 35 representatives took part at WGISS, with an additional 20 or soat sub-group and related meetings. Australian participants were: Jeff Kingwell, CSIRO Office of Space Science & Applications/Earth ObservationCentre Murray Wilson, CSIRO EOC Dr Peter Turner, CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research Dr John Lilleyman, CSIRO Division of Information Technology Mr Karl Nissen, Australian Centre for Remote Sensing. Dr Lilleyman's trip was funded by NASDA, which is supporting the CSIRO-ledPlenary Network Demonstration. Mr Nissen's visit was primarily NASDA funded,for attendance at the ESCAP meeting. Background The primary international Earth Observation body, the Committee on EarthObservation Satellites (CEOS), is an informal organisation in which spaceagencies work towards matching planned Earth-observing space missions tothe requirements of data users. Members include virtually all civil agenciesmanaging Earth observing (ie remote sensing, including meteorological) satellitesor carrying out major research programs in this area. International institutionalusers of Earth observation data, or organisations with extensive ground-basedEO responsibilities, are eligible for Affiliate or Observer status, respectively.Typical Affiliates are the World Meteorological Organization, the UN Foodand Agriculture Organization, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission,and the Global Climate Observing System. CEOS began in 1984 among the G7 group of advanced economic nations. In additionto founding organisations from North America (NASA, NOAA), Europe (ESA),and Japan (STA/NASDA), CEOS now includes satellite-management agencies fromRussia, Ukraine, China, and space research organisations from India, Braziland Australia. CSIRO joined in 1989; its membership represents a commitmentto maximise Australia's environmental, social and economic benefits fromspace technology. The CSIRO Office of Space Science & Applications (COSSA) representsCSIRO interests in CEOS and is the only Australian member. CSIRO co-ordinateson CEOS matters with the Commonwealth Spatial Data Committee, the AustralianCentre for Remote Sensing, the Space Council, and other interested agencies.COSSA's Head, Dr Brian Embleton, is the current chair of CEOS, and CSIROwill host the 10th Plenary, comprising about 100 space agency heads andresearch managers, in Canberra, 13-15 November 1996. CEOS Working Groups CEOS' Working Group on Calibration and Validation (WGCV) manages internationalefforts to verify the accuracy and reliability of satellite data. CEOS's Working Group on Information Systems and Services (WGISS) carriesout technical tasks and standards definition, on data management; accesstools (such as WWW user interfaces); and in network infrastructure and performance.WGISS was created in Moscow, November 1995, from a merger of the formerWG Data and the WG on International Network Services. It encourages a client-orientedperspective on Earth observation data management and distribution. CSIRO interests in WGISS CSIRO has been an active member of WGISS and its predecessor, WGD, since1992. The first two of WGISS' twenty-odd projects are led by CSIRO. Thefirst, the "CEOS Plenary Network Demonstrator", will demonstratehigh-bandwidth real-time data transmission of satellite data, from the ADEOSsatellite due to be launched by Japan's National Space Development Agencyon 17 August. Using a dedicated leased 300 kbps line, moving window quicklook data from ADEOS, as received at the Hatoyama ground station, will berelayed to the CEOS 10th Plenary in the National Convention Centre, Canberra.The viewer's impression will be as if the observer was travelling on thespacecraft, looking down at Earth in the vicinity of Japan. This is believedto be the first example of intercontinental real-time image transmissionfrom a remote sensing satellite. The demonstrator will also show both realtimeand off-line data searching and retrieval, from Earth observation data centresin India, China, Australia, and possibly Thailand. Using the ExperimentalBroadband Network and the facilities of CRCs in Research Data Networks andAdvanced Computational Systems, these data will be processed in real timein a distributed high performance computing environment. The second Australian-led technical project under WGISS is an educationalCD-ROM, containing case studies and datasets illustrating the social benefitsof earth observation. This package is designed to be particularly usefulin developing countries, and in schools. It will contain information previouslyonly available at high cost, or to those with substantial network capacity. CSIRO's efforts in geoscience data networks have also included contributionsto feasibility studies by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asiaand the Pacific (ESCAP), towards an Earth-Space Information Network forAsia and the Pacific, ESINAP. In September 1994, over 20 Ministers responsiblefor space programs in the Asia-Pacific region assembled in Beijing, wherethey endorsed a new ESCAP "Space Technology Applications for SustainableDevelopment Program". ESINAP is being promoted under this Program,notably through sponsorship by the government of Japan, which is also supportingcontemporaneous and similar proposals bilaterally with the USA (the "Globalearth Observation Information Network, GOIN), and regionally, through APEC's"Asia-Pacific Information Infrastructure Initiative", and internationally,through the G7 Environment and Natural Resources Information Network pilotproject. To a high degree, these represent congruent proposals, under different forums.CSIRO believes that its own work on Earth science data networks, which arefocused on the Asia Pacific region, can contribute significantly to theobjectives of CEOS, ESCAP, and APEC. Introductions Tasuku Tanaka spoke on the Earth Observation Research Centre, which he hasled since it opened in April. The EORC and employs about 100 staff (currentlyincludes several officers seconded from CNES) plus about 50 contractors.The EORC has appointed Program scientists for each of NASDA major missions- ADEOS, TRMM, and JERS. Hiroshi Kikuchi noted that NASDA have also established a series of semi-privateorganisations to facilitate international co-operation. They have employedMs Cheiw from China, Mr Chaudhury (ex ESCAP), based in Bangkok, and a numberof others, for training and liaison purposes. Plenary issues I delivered a message on behalf of the CEOS Chair: the WGISS plan shows clearly the function of the WG, and guides itsform accordingly. The user orientation of WGISS is timely , and has helpedplace CEOS in the driver's seat for long term co-ordination of Earth environmentmonitoring. For information, the following issues have been identified as high profilethemes for the current year: planning and analysis task force on gaps & overlaps in space missions integration of space & in situ measurement continuing validity of differentiation of members, observers &affiliates developing country issues appropriate technology access & training agency/national actions (ILS, CD, ESINAP) promotion of value of EO (Yellow Pages, InfoSys, CD, Newsletter) On horizon, CEOS faces the following challenges: enhanced EO capability of photogrammetric quality stereo near realtime imagery related issue of relationship between public & private sectordata providers Chair welcomes appointment of Sec's Dr Alan Belward as incoming WGCV chair.New process of consultation off-line chosen in order to increase proportionof Plenary time available for substantive issues and technical demonstrations. Summary of IGOS meeting in Seattle Refer documents 8, 9. CSIRO Space Industry News, Edition 68, was also notedas containing a summary of the Seattle meeting. The Integrated Global ObservingStrategy is an exciting development which in some ways was anticipated bywork conducted by WGISS on data interuse, and on the use of single datasystems for multiple user communities. Five year plan The following sub-group appointments were approved: Networks. Chair: Mr Richard desJardins (desjardi@eos.nasa.gov), NASA. Vicechair Professor Kohei Arai, Saga University/NASDA. Access. Chair: Mr Terry Fisher, CCRS. Vice Chair Dr Luigi Fusco, ESA/ESRIN. Data. Chair: Mr Gunther Schreier, DARA/DLR. Vice chair Dr Wyn Cudlip, BNSC/DRA. The new appointments are to be effective immediately, and the past sub groupchairs be requested to assist the new chairs in making a swift and effectivetransition to the new structure. The role of the User Sub-group (or Panel) caused the greatest difficulty.Among the issues were - should user input be mandatory and structured, forevery task, including existing ones? How can the interests of users whoare not in Affiliated organisations be recognised? And should user interestsbe a matrix activity, rather than a parallel sub-group? The Version 0.5b, plus agreed change list, plus new language on user panel,was accepted as Version 1 (the 1996 issue) of the WGISS 5 year plan, withthanks to the writing panel recorded. The former SG chairs were thanked for their achievements and the chair wasasked to write on behalf of WGISS to their respective agencies, noting thatevolution of WGISS has resulted in the former groups becoming superseded,thanking the former chairs for the body of accomplishment, thanking theagencies for their support, and where appropriate, seeking a continuinginvolvement in SG actions. New Tasks i) Natural Hazards Martha Maiden spoke about Miriam Baltuck's proposal for a new WGISS taskin Natural Hazards. This has some elements in common with the CSIRO CD-ROMproject, for example, the contact details guide, and with the Plenary NetworkDemonstrator, with the scenario based approach to data retrieval, analysisand distribution. (Reference 19). Discussion led to conclusion that theinitiative should involve a broader group; should carefully define the outputproducts, and incorporate in its initial phase a review of current relatedaction. This could take the form of a Workshop, initiated by CEOS. ii) Network work area themes desJardins outlined a program of network security; network performance;and network architecture. What were formerly known as "network tools" are now called "usertools" and will be run by the Access sub-group, with related taskssuch as the WWW. Security desJardins spoke to a NASA/NASDA white paper (Reference 5). Issues include user authentication unauthorised use data set protection data set exchange iii) CEOS Information Locater Service Demonstrator Project Thomas Ruuwe spoke to Reference 20. CILS will use the CEO ESWE software(public domain). Semi automatic generation of IDN DIFs. Presentation atToulouse Plenary, then at WGISS4. IMS protocol to major catalogues, with CIP upgrade path. Will draw togetherwith G7 ENRM metadata task (chaired CEO/EEA). Planned that US GovernmentInformation Locator System, CEOS IDN upgrades, CEO advertising & announcementservice, ESA's MUIS, and NASA's EosDIS, will all have interfaces with CILS.CSIRO has been invited by DLR to act as the Asia-Pacific node for CILS,with a CILS server at the CSIRO EOC, for the demonstration phase of theproject (~1997). This would place the EOC at a strategic junction pointbetween low and high-level information networks and their upgrades and interfaces. iv) Strategy Kikuchi proposed a Strategy task, with a time scale of 10/15 years, withthe responsibility to consider long term issues and preparing for 5 yearplan revision and transition between near and long term action plans. Thisidea met general acceptance: the WGISS chairs, sub-group chairs, and otherswill comprise the team. Task reports Yellow Pages This is a directory of on-line services, led by Shinichi Sobue of NASDA.Deadline for inputs is July 1996. Presentation will be at WGISS 3 Plenary Network Demonstrator Kingwell gave an introduction to the Demonstrator (WGISS Task 1), coveringpurpose (Asia-Pacific mission displays; promote achievements of WGISS, developnetwork and distributed processing methods). Reference 11. A special ProjectTeam meeting was chaired by Lilleyman on 30 May. CSIRO CD-ROM Kingwell discussed Reference 10 covering WGISS Task 2 - genesis, purpose,content, future plans relative to the CD for developing countries and educationalinstitutions. Feedback included NASA declaring continued interest; repeatedoffer of CD version of CEOS InfoSys, time permitting; suggestion to includeall or part of Yellow Pages guide; and action to provide contact informationto CSIRO. Ocean colour John Withrow spoke on Reference 24. Work is leading to a Workshop on datamerging and integration, and publication of data distribution policies,and distribution of algorithms for processing ocean colour data. Part ofobjective is to devise means of integrating ocean colour data from differentsources. Users have specific requirements: . one format . access to algorithms . guide to data policies European Wide Service Exchange Ken Ingliss covered this. One advantage was that it allowed users, who havetheir own data, to into relevant information on the system. In effect ,EWSE is a self-building information system which contains advertisements,data centre descriptions, and provides resources, including data browse,access and ordering services. G-7 ENRM Ken Ingliss also spoke on the G7 Environment & Natural Resource Managementdata project (Reference 26). It seems as if CEO is creating a niche in largescale data management projects funded by European Community, and is effectivelydrawing together the growing number of "information superhighway"proposals championed by disparate communities. For example, the CEO is thecommon link between, and is ensuring compatibility and best fit of, G-7,CEOS International Directory Network, DARA's Information Locator Service,and related work. Australia is participating in the G-7 through Kate Ordof ERIN, but we have yet to forge a similar link between AEON, CEOS PlenaryNetwork demonstrator, ANZLIC/CSDC, NRIC's directory database, etc. Sub group Reports Format report Wyn Cudlip noted an ESA report on format approaches - Common format, HDF,CEOS superstructure, etc. This seemed like a comprehensive and useful reference. FS has a Data interuse reference (conceptual) model. Agency reports ISRO National Resources information system links ISRO with user departments.Covered IRS-1c, IRS-P3 (with MOS), launched early 1996. IRS-P4 to be launched1997, with 9 band ocean colour instrument. IRS-P6, in 1999, to have 2.5m pixel. Being studied - CARTO-2, with < 1m pixel, ~ 2002. Applications/missionsstudied include DTM (< 5 m), multi-crop analysis. Current applicationsshown in crop monitoring with IRS-1C; cadastral review; snow/cloud differentiation. Next meeting September 16-20 Sub group meetings, inc, Sioux Falls, EROS DC Globe, Mapping October 8-10 WGISS 3 Neustralitz, 100 km north of Berlin, hosted by DARA/DLR. The WGISS-3 meeting will focus on: . Task reviews (with exception of CSIRO's 1, 2, covered this meeting) . User group initial actions and approach. April/May 1997 WGISS-4, Ottawa CCRS Canada. Options: 6-8, 7-9, 13-15 May, or 15-17 April. CCRS asking for preferences. 29 May 1996: Joint WGISS/sub-group meeting Presentation on Earth Space Information Network for Asia and Pacific Dr He Changchui made a presentation on behalf of the 60 members of ESCAP,comprising 57% of world's population and about 31 m km2 . He explained therelevance of the Network in addressing regional problems - natural disasters,national development, poverty alleviation. Issues included: - rationalisation of ground segment - access to information (equity, speedy distribution) - data management including archiving He gave example which showed how ESINAP concept is already working at levelof human network and manual data transfer - fires in China, and assistancefrom Thai, Indian ground stations. He stated that after the feasibility study, one of Australia, Thailand orJapan were suggested as the master node. For implementation of network, ESCAP estimate a budget of about $US125 000 for a "minimum test mode", consisting of one primarynode and a client. "Full test node", with 8 national nodes inthe region, would cost about $US500 000. Recurrent costs would be about$US400 000. This will be based on voluntary support, with "basic"funding from ESTO. He was pleased that the CEOS Plenary Network Demonstrationwas, in effect, a test of the ESINAP prototype. (This was a dynamic presentation,very complimentary to CSIRO and Australia). Five year plan Helen Wood and Alan Haskell presented the approved plan (Version 1.0). Notedthe new tasks in Networks, Natural Hazards, the ILS; and the new themeson strategic planning and promotion. Resources must be assigned for tasks to be accepted, and Task leaders mustsign-off on concluded or abandoned tasks, citing lessons learnt. Other meetings I had several side meetings with NASDA personnel, and took part in the PlenaryNetwork Project Team meeting (separate report by J Lilleyman refers), andthe special meeting on ESCAP issues.

Annapolis, Md, USA June 10 - 12 1996 Symposium Themes To inform users of current and future plans of US and internationalpolar satellite systems To discuss the changes in NOAA's upcoming satellites (NOAA K, L &M), including changes in their direct broadcast systems. The U.S. Congress has reaffirmed "free access" to the data. Therehas been a significant increase in the number of amateur users of the data. Currently NOAA 14 is the primary afternoon satellite & NOAA 12 is theprimary morning satellite. The Search & Rescue Processor (SARP) on NOAA 14 has been inoperativesince launch. The backup computer failed. The next series of satellites, NOAA K to N will be the fifth generationof NOAA satellites. The changes include: the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) and Stratospheric Sounding Unit(SSU) will be discontinued the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit, AMSU-A & AMSU-B will beadded the AVHRR/2 has been updated (to AVHRR/3) by adding a sixth channelat 1.6 microns. It will be known as channel 3A; channel 3B corresponds toch3 of the AVHRR/2 instrument. These two channels will be operated alternately,3A during the day & 3B at night, although there was much discussionof this during the meeting. Due to limited bandwidth A & B cannot beoperated simultaneously. The use of data compression is being examined. additional sunshield for calibration, more solar panels, extra instruments= increased weight of satellite HIRS/2 replaced by HIRS/3 - a change in the calibration sequence. increased data transmission rate (1200 to 2560 bits/sec). after NOAA K, command encryption will be used. With these changes the stored and real-time data formats have changed. Fordetails see http://psbsgi1.nesdis.noaa.gov:8080/noaasis.html NOAA K may be launched sometime in 1997, but could be much later. Launchdates will be dependent on failure of operating satellite for this series.Some discussion of what "failure" meant, as in the case of NOAA11 where the decayed orbit rendered much of the Earth observation data unusable. NOAA & Eumetsat plan a joint polar program beginning 2001. NOAA to provideafternoon spacecraft (NOAA N & N'), Eumetsat to provide morning spacecraft(METOP-1 & -2). The METOP satellites will carry the same instrumentsas the NOAA series, with additional European instruments. Eumetsat is developing a standard software package (EARP - Eumetsat ATOVSRetrieval System) for processing locally received ATOVS & AVHRR datafrom the HRPT stream of the NOAA K, L, M satellites, and the future METOPs.It is a combined effort between Meteo France, KNMI, UK Met Office, DWD,ECMWF and ARA/LMD. This software will be freely available. There is a planned convergence of the NOAA POES program and DMSP, to becomethe National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS).It will be a co-operative effort between the Dept of Commerce, the Deptof Defence, and NASA. This has been prompted by US budget savings, and wasdirected by the President in 1994. The increased use of radio frequencies is creating interference betweenthe metsats & other users. The World Radio Administrative Conference(WRAC) in 1992 allocated two bands used by APT & HRPT to the MobileSatellite Service (MSS). NOAA is monitoring the situation. Applications of POES data were presented at the symposium, including biomassburning and aerosol detection, snow applications, coastal zone hazards andthe Global 1km project. Some educational programs in earth observation systems and satellite technologywere described.

Funding for the1km project has not been affected as NASA & IGBP are highly supportiveof the project. The pathfinder program provides stability. Alessandra Buongiorno, representing the ESA stations described their currentoperation. ESA is using LAS/ADAPS and providing stitched orbit data tothe USGS, and vice versa. Archiving on optical tape. Kevin Gallo - NOAA 's contribution is to ensure the recorders are scheduled. This data is free to the USGS now. Project Status Reports & Data Acquisition (USGS) Data comes from Tokyo university via ftp now, ~3 scenes per day. Possibilityof faster link from Australia to USA via Japan? Data from October 1993 to September 1994 will not be used for global compositesdue to the Southern hemisphere being in darkness. The passes are, however,stitched & archived. All of the 10 day composites for April 92 - September 93 should be finishedby the end of September this year. The data will be circulated, approximately200 tapes worth. Stitching of NOAA14 orbits will begin also in September,using data as of 1 February 1995. New atmospheric corrections have been published by John R Townshend, "A version 2 AVHRR multi-resolution land pathfinder data set ". NOAA 14 status: - correct calibration coefficients from NOASIS web site - thermal channels affected by seeing sunlight in the calibrating "space-look", gain calculations affected.

Rest of ESA stations represented by Alessandra Buongiorno. Science Requirements & Extension of Project Martha Maiden stated that NASA envisioned the project continuing indefinitely,perhaps becoming more stabilised with time. The EROS Data Centre has strongsupport for the project as part of Mission to Planet Earth. All partiesagreed to continue until September 1998 ( by which time the 1996 data shouldbe processed ). Information on anyone using the global product, or anyother science requirements should be fed back to NASA or EDC. Data Processing / Product Distribution EDC intends to get a global data set of control points due to errorsin the DCW. Interest in Australia's MSS mosaic. NOAA provides quality assessment of the Global product by comparing NDVIwith 8km NDVI. Information re the global composites is currently taking 4 to 7 months togo online (IMS limitations). NOAA Update (Dan Tarpley) Dan outlined the changes with the NOAA K, L, M series: additional / replacement sensors calibration changes in reflectance channels 1.6 & 3.7 micron channel (1km group should vote in the time-sharing) new launch policy (on failure of previous satellite) better launch rocket by NOAA L NPOESS to take over ~ 2008 1-KM Data Set Projects, Applications, and Related Platforms SPOT VEGETATION Update (Gilbert Saint, JRC) The products from the Vegetation instruments (Veg-1 & Veg-2) will bedistributed by SPOT at a minimal cost. Veg-1 should begin operation in1997, Veg-2 in 2002. L-band reception may be free, with some charge forcorrection parameters. National Snow & Ice Data Centre (Ted Scambos & Todd Hutchinson) NSIDC collects & composites data over the poles to create products suchas albedo, surface temperature, sea-ice movement. Discussed the problemsof rapid local time changes across the poles. AVHRR Calibration (Eric Vermote, University of Maryland) Near real-time calibration using ocean and cloud views. Ratio of ch1/ch2over the pacific ocean, where aerosol contribution is negligible, in thepresence of high altitude thick cloud (considered spectrally flat). Ozonecan be accurately measured (TOVS, SeaWIFs) thus effects due to Rayleighscattering can be isolated. The process currently has a 9 day turnaround. AVHRR Global Fire Product (Jackie Kendal, NASA) Fire Algorithm Working Group, NGSFC. See IGBP-DIS home page. The objective is to provide a standard global fire product. So far haveproduced a prototype data set from Global AVHRR 1km product (June 25 1992)and are validating it against DMSP & GOES data, high resolution satellitedata, and results from field experiments (SAFARI, SCAR(s), EXPRESSO, Firescan).Hope to publish the first product March 97, on cdrom. NOAA Urban Heat Island Project (Kevin Gallo, NOAA) Using NDVI and DMSP OLS. Results: a heat island bias is likely to be presentin the observed temperatures for stations with a lower NDVI than their surroundinglandscapes. Discussion All present reaffirmed continuation of the project. Another meetingis expected to be held before next (Northern) summer. Kevin Gallo advised of the next NOAA meeting, on satellite applications,March 4 - 6, North Carolina. Details at NOAA's website ( http://www.noaa.gov).

These three phenomena are linked by landcover, the cover of vegetation andsoils, and so fundamental is this linkage that the dynamic attributes oflandcover structure, functioning and composition are, and will remain essentialcomponents of all environmental assessments and forecasts. Such is the nature of these three phenomena, that comprehensive and quantitativeassessment and monitoring of their extent, severity and dynamics of theirimpact on landcover can only be based on information derived from Earthobservation data. Therefore, the development and application of techniques to assess and monitorthe relevant landcover attributes using Earth observation data becomes thefocus of the Global Change Project. The nature of landcover is determined by soil and climatic factors; it isinfluenced by the dynamics of climate and atmospheric composition; and itis transformed by landuse. Furthermore, landcover will not only respond to climatic, atmospheric andlanduse change, the impact, it can also influence future climates, atmosphericcomposition and landuse, the feedback. All three components are inextricably linked, and the interactions are criticalto predictive understanding. Global Change is defined as the reciprocal interaction of Climate- and LanduseChange with the landcover component of the Terrestrial Biosphere. It addressesthe interaction of social systems (landuse) with natural systems (climate& landcover). Global Change is expressed by the dynamics of functioning, structure, andcomposition over timescales of decades to centuries, and aggregated overthe spatial scales of landscape to global. Conceptual Framework: Global Change Project The following framework links human needs and wants (the fundamentaldrivers of change) through landuse and landcover change to Greenhouse ClimateChange, Sustainable Landuse (Land Degradation), and Biotic Erosion (Lossof Biodiversity). The interactions are: (1) Landuse-landcover transformations and conversions; (2) Enhanced Greenhouse Effect; (3) Trace Gas Feedback on the Climate System; (4) Nitrogen & CO2 Fertilisation Effect; (5) Boundary Conditions Feedback on the Climate System; (6) Climatic Determinant of Landcover; (7) if negative, then Land Degradation ; (8) Net Change in Functioning (eg. NPP), Structure (eg. biomass) or speciescomposition (eg. Biotic Erosion). There is appreciable remote sensing research being directed to quantifyingthe interactions listed above. This effort will continue to grow, nationallyand globally. Defining statements: Global Change Project Vision: To quantify the uncertainties of Global Change. Strategic research objectives: - to engage the big issues and articulate over-the-horizonthinking in the scientific questions not yet being addressed but which willdefine prospective research and data requirements; - to derive landcover functioning, structural and composition attributesfrom remotely sensed data using measurement models and data integration; - to apply and validate methods to detect and interpret change inderived landcover variables; - to develop continental-scale landcover assessment and monitoringcapability and capacity with which to detect and interpret the progressof Global Change; - to document and publish all generated datasets.

Graetz] OBJECTIVES To explore potential landcover changes over the entire Australian continent,for the next 70 years (1990 - 2060), and the direct feedback of these changeson the Climate System . QUESTIONS ADDRESSED What are the existing continental patterns of landcover structure, phenologyand composition; and what soil, climatic and landuse factors are the determinantsof these patterns? What are the minimum set of plausible scenarios (1990 - 2060) for theseclimatic and landuse factors? What will be the resultant spatial and temporal patterns of landcover changeunder each scenario, and thus the strength and sign of the direct (changedsurface conditions) feedback on the Climate System? METHODOLOGY Explore the spatial patterns of landcover change probability using landusechange scenarios that capture the interaction of the evolution of both climaticand social systems; Compute the direct feedback on the Climate System of the resultant landcoverchanges from the various scenarios; Design and demonstrate a methodology to assimilate and test the generatedlandcover change hypotheses (probability patterns) in an iterative 3-D dataassimilation mode, thereby largely overcoming the problem of model validation.

[R.D. Graetz] OBJECTIVES To develop and apply a methodology for converting TOA broad waveband reflectancesin the visible and near-infrared to surface values, retrospectively andprospectively, using a network of spectrally invariant ground targets. QUESTIONS ADDRESSED What is the size and sign of the atmospheric contribution to clear-sky,broad waveband visible and near-infrared reflectances derived from the MSS,AVHRR and other instruments, calculated TOA? What are the spatial and temporal patterns in the size and sign of the atmosphericcontribution, and in what way can these be related to the synoptic air masscharacteristics, or otherwise geographically zoned over the continent? What are the characteristics of a network of ground targets that would becritical prerequisites for their use to provide an empirical atmosphericcorrection to AVHRR data in an operational context, retrospectively andprospectively. METHODOLOGY Using the AVHRR archive (1981 - ), to locate ground targets that exhibitinvariant or systematically varying spectral characteristics within thethree classes of low (eg. water bodies), mid (eg. bare rock outcrops), andhigh reflectance (eg. salinas) in the visible and near-infrared wavebands.

Subproject D4 TITLE & AUTHOR The development and validation of a spatial-spectral measurement model todetect and quantify change in tree/shrub density over a herbaceous understorey.[R.D. Graetz] OBJECTIVES To develop and test simple spatial-spectral models to quantify the canopycover / density in sparsely wooded grasslands using high spatial resolutionSPOT data. QUESTIONS ADDRESSED Is it possible to quantify thinning (not clearing) and regrowth of nativetrees/shrubs within recently cleared and established pastures; eg. in CentralQueensland? Is it possible to quantify the invasion of native grasslands by the exoticshrubs and trees; eg. Acacia nilotica in the Mitchell grasslands of WesternQueensland. METHODOLOGY On the basis of on the length of archive and certainty of change, pairedscenes (5 years apart) will be chosen for which MSS and Panchromatic dataavailable and which capture the maximum spectral contrast between woodyoverstorey and grassy understorey. A spatial analysis of spectral variance ('smart filtering') will be appliedto the youngest scene to infer tree density. After geometric and radiometricnormalisation, the same analysis will be applied to the oldest scene, andto the youngest-oldest scene difference image to infer change in tree density. Subject to confirmation by field measurement, a third scene (1996) willbe requested that, in conjunction with contemporary field measurements,will validate the technique. OUTPUTS The pilot project would be reported in the format of an electronic documenton CD-ROM published by CSIRO. The CD-ROM would be written in standard formatand include browsing and viewing of software compatible across UNIX, DOS,and Macintosh platforms. DATA REQUIREMENTS & PRODUCTS Requirements: - Panchromatic and MSS digital data sets for one full SPOT scene on threeseparate dates. Products: - None, other than on the CDROM mentioned above. FUNDING This project is not directly funded. However, SPOT Imaging Services is providingthe digital datasets gratis, and staff help in searching the SPOT archive.This project will pursued (if possible) as a component of part 3 of D2 listedabove.

Graetz] OBJECTIVE This project will extend the analysis of biomass burning over the Australiancontinent currently being undertaken by the author for the period 1981-1990(NGGI-funded) to 1998, thereby providing and publishing a total record of17 years. This record will be used to: quantify the relative influence ofclimate (interannual variation), landuse (people), and their interactionin determining fire frequency; detect and interpret trends in continentalfire regime, 1981-1998; model the impact of future climate and landuse scenarios(to 2060) on fire frequencies. This proposal, and a companion 'Ozflux: The translation of GCM simulationsof future climates into impacts at landscape scales', by Raupach, Cleugh& Graetz, have been submitted for funding to DEST in response to itsinitiative on Climate Change Impact Assessment. Both this proposed subproject and D6 which follows, will make extensiveuse of the experience and data from the GMS Pathfinder Project, and potentiallyfrom the VEGETATION instrument to be carried on SPOT 4 in 1997. A strategicobjective of the Global Change Project is data integration; not only ofremotely sensed data with that from other sources, but also between spacedatasets, see later. D6: TITLE & AUTHOR ARTEMIS: Australia, Real-Time Environmental Monitoring Information System[Graetz, R.D. et al] OBJECTIVE To develop a continental-scale, Terrestrial Biosphere Monitoring Systemwith which to detect and interpret the progress of Global Change, retrospectivelyand prospectively. This subproject is being planned in anticipation of a national requirementfor this capability and capacity that has yet to emerge, but for which theEOC could be the principal contributor. It is planned that such a capability would exploit the synergy of the AVHRRdata stream with that of GMS. The contribution of the Global Change Projectto the GMS Pathfinder Project is to enact and explore this synergy in thederivation of seven Level 3 products;
